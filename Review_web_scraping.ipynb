      "Review 1: When it comes to entertainment Raj & Dk are perfectionalist to the core ,they are completely control of audience pulse and can convince them much better...With a tried not tested kind of plot the duo does take time to settle may be an episode of two,but the path breaking ground work behind each statistics and analysis won't come so easily which is clearly visible on screen but this duo does these kind of things coz they hugely trust the castings and their ability...Bhuvan Arora and Vijay sethupathi stealers of the shows with their natural ability to carry over the screenplay on their shoulder at ease ...When the \"LAST OF US \" are countering problems in seeking attention...this \"FARZI\" depends entirely on the plot based scripting and screenplay supported by superb casting but wait the crackers are just lit watch the fireworks on season 2 for sure u will be out in a roller coaster ride with some visual brilliance...\n",
      "Review 2: Its been an amazing to watch the acting. I loved Shahid's dialogue delivery, Vijays acting and how he beautifully managed accent and dialects. Fresh story, very good actors and solid punches.Narration is super crisp, connected and well crafted. After a long time, i watched something natural and no filmy/fancy. Director has hand picked people for each roles and delivered with maximum impact. Each character from Chachu to Firoz to Nanu to Kay Kay has done justice to their roles. This is something you cannot miss if you want to watch powerful acting, thrilling story.An absolute and a MUST watch.\n",
      "Review 3: I have a habit of fast forwarding scenes but I tell you every single minute here counts.. I had to rewind those 5 - 10 seconds which I missed. This is the perfection and in future it seems to get married to Family man! The hint was dropped in the series!Every actor, every scene is perfectly crafted and an excellent research on the topic, as if the actual people behind this were interviewed :)If there is no back ground music and we don't know the actors this might come as a docuseries as well ha ha :) :) - pun intendedCredit to Raj and DK for creating yet another amazing seriesMust watch.\n",
      "Review 4: FANTABOLOUSNo crap just straight topoint..#ShahidKapoor Just nailed it üëåüèª but The conversation b/w minister & Sethupathi is the major highlight ... Just wow. And the epic style of dialogue delivery, outstandingüëåüèªsense of humour, precise comic timing = VijaySethupathi Sir, He is genius, He again prove there is No need of Six Packs to be a good actor.The plot itself is the gold-medalist, where the one-liners, actors, characters, writing & humor are the flag-bearers. RajNDK never fails in content. A RECOMMENDED WEEKEND WATCH . Don't miss it just open the prime and enjoy the thrill of RAJ AND DK.\n",
      "Review 5: Farzi is a stellar watch. Raj & DK outdo themselves with this original crime caper. Outstanding storytelling. A dream cast of Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi and Kay Kay Menon at the top of their game. Brilliant performances by a terrific ensemble. The writing is sharp and witty, all thanks to Raj & DK along with Sumana Kumar and Sita Menon. The production value is top notch. The cinematography is amazing. The attention to details is the USP of this series. The amount of hard work put on the table by the cast and crew is incredible to watch. One of the best shows to come out of an Indian OTT space in recent times. Do not miss this.\n",
      "Review 6: This serial had a great premise, and Shahid Kapoor's acting is superb for the role he's playing. But the positives end here. Rest of the cast is pretty much meh, and Vijay is an extremely bad choice for the role he's playing. The worst thing is the script. There is a serious pacing issue. Every episode has lot of stuff that's solely for stretching the story. There are numerous loopholes and technical errors as well. In simpler words, the concept could have been handled far better in the hands of a better director. Because this concept could be done really well. It's kind of Hindi Breaking Bad. But what they have created instead is an extremely boring TV serial with numerous logical errors. Be frank, I'm disappointed, because from the trailer it felt really good. I could only watch 3 episodes and then I came here and read that it gets worse in later episodes. So I stopped wasting more of my time on this.\n",
      "Review 7: This show is a Banger . Excellent Cast , Depth in Characters and Brilliant Story Telling. That's how a Crime Thriller should be . Once you Start Watching the Show you will binge it for sure. Shahid Kapoor , Vijay Sethupati , Kay Kay Menon , Zakir Khan, Amol Palekar all are excellent. Can't wait now for S2 as it ended on a High Note. The Universe that Raj and DK are planning is exciting and interesting . Shahid is the Hero of the show and he proves how good actor he is. For me After Mirzapur and Family Man this is the Best Series coming from IndiaMust watch for sure . A Perfect 10 from my side.\n",
      "Review 8: Farzi is unlike earlier Raj and DK famous series The Family Man which in both the season not looked boring or stretched but this looked like an effort to unnecessarily took the narrative to the next season.Even if they want second series this should be fast paced and can be end in 5 or 6 episodes. Apart from length the series has an amazing story-line, good dialogues and awesome performances specially Bhuvan Arora and Kay Kay Menon. Shahid Kapoor,Vijay Sethupati,Rashi Khanna, Amol Palekar all reprise their role nicely.I hope to watch more thrill,more twists - turns and fun in the next season.\n",
      "Review 9: Overall the web series has 8 episodes all the character development has been very well established with few characters background kept secret which I think will be shown in season 2. All the actors have performed well Shahid Kaoor, Raashii Khanna, K K, Veteran actor Amol Palekar and Bhuvan Arora all are good but Vijay Sethupathi has absolutely nailed in few scenes his Comic timing is so good that one watching will laugh out loud. Vijay Sethupathi performance is a masterpiece and will be loved by all Farzi from starting till the end scene is a absolute thriller , eagerly waiting for Season 2....\n",
      "Review 10: The plot is a great artist and his friend getting into criminal world for many reasons he cites in the webseries. The protagonist is grey and the last line is the exact characterization him - \"I don't know myself...\". One thing leads to another and he is recruited into the criminal world of Kay Kay Menon.Vijay Sethupathi looks lazy and seems he is rehashing the same old acting in other countless movies he has done in the past. The romantic plot looks forced and it has given a good lead to the 2nd part. The screenplay is good but Reginas part has nothing to do with the story, and was a bit boring. Good webseries from Raj & DK!!\n",
      "Review 11: This web series is a a high level of series. Now it has created a high benchmark for other web series. Everything here is a piece of art. Right from acting to action,one word that perfectly matches is \"perfect \". Shahid Kapoor is always good but here he did a fabulous job and this is one of the best work of his life. The series is a complete package of best actors giving their best works. Kay Kay Menon is seen in gray shade and it's very appreciable. If you have watched \"Family man\",you would immediately understand that it's a product of the same director Raj and DK. The signature scene where an old man buying vegetables gives information to police and immediately breaks the sim and throws it, is just wow. This series is a complete entertainment series and every episode is better than the previous one. Do watch it now,it's highly recommended. Its streaming on amazon prime.\n",
      "Review 12: Good story, excellent acting. But quite a few flaws in script and direction. Especially the last episode. Placed in 2021 it looks idiotic that law enforcement could not seal the parking lot of a mall. It is also unbelievable that phones of investigating officers are not sanitized. The initial raid in Nepal also appeared amateurish with security walking into hotel with no lookouts from the criminal's bodyguards. The overall script and storyline is great. The detailing of the crime is excellent as is the hallmark of earlier DK Raj production. Do not get mislead by the first 30 mts of first episode. The web series starts slow but then picks up a consistent pace.\n",
      "Review 13: Apart from Shahid Kapoor, the entire cast seem like terrible b-list actors. The characters are all so inept except for Sunny, especially Megha who looks like she got the job by persistently being annoying rather than on any merit. The story is interesting and well crafted, even if its filled with the usual cliches, I can see the similarites between Breaking Bad in some of the characters and Narcos in some of the scenarios. Despite that, I keep getting taken out of the moment in each climatic scene with the terrible acting, like they all just came out of improv school. The traditional cat and mouse is more like pandas trying to chase down a lion.\n",
      "Review 14: A really different topic chosen to discover about money mana factoring with a good under dog story staring shahid kapoor. Some fake crimes shown with ok masala at the start but good emotional touch. Shahids screen presence keeps the series safe. Later on to save the day Vijay setupati kicks in with the tadka good acting and screen presence felt but his Hindi isn't too promising currently on the run. The face off comes later on but till then the story keeps you entertained with less action. The climax offers the face off and action with a emotional twist. The story and twists are very good blended in. Some moments you might feel the series is dragging but the audience still wants more so the runtime is met. Overall a must watch if you have some time to jump into something fresh!\n",
      "Review 15: The series starts off great until Episode 6 and then falls flat. Shahid Kapoor seems to overact towards the end when he is unable to take any sensible decision. The romantic angle between Shahid and Rashi Khanna was unnecessary. The only saving grace is Michael (Vijay Sethupathi). Brilliant acting. This series could've done a lot better in terms of giving a sensible ending to Season 1. It was so silly how they got away in Epi 8. The plot is brilliant and the series will keep you hooked atleast until episode 6. A sorry case of ruining the story by bringing unncessary romantic angle and then acting on your feelings. Farzi is good but not the best. Lets hope we see more screentime between Michael and Sunny.\n",
      "Review 16: Just watch it, and I bet you can't leave your couch without finishing all the episodes. Damm good performance by Sahid Kapoor and Vijay Setupati what a series ! Already awaiting for the 2nd season. Storyline screenplay acting every bit of this series is damm good. Do not wait if you are done with pathaan then just watch it, you will remember these eight episodes. After many days watched Amol Palekars acting he is as good as his old days. I don't know the name of the Sahid's friend but he is also too good and very soon he will become known face to everyone I am sure. My weekend just started with the blast what a series, too good.\n",
      "Review 17: Loved this webseries...a very unique and a different story plot...very well executed...chemistry of gahlot and michael is too good(its like i was literally waiting for their scenes).....i felt a little less depth in shahid's character in contrast to kay kay menon sir(mansoor )...despite of that i think everyone did well in acting area...at some points story felt a bit slow and couldntkept me with it but those were just 4-5 scenes im talking about not a big issue....the cinematography was good i loved the vibe and the rawness was a cherry on top...i didnt like vfx that much but yeah i know its a webseries but still they could have done better....thanx.\n",
      "Review 18: You sit with expections with huge casts , but the story buildup is very poory and boring , though the acting part well taken care off , even in the second episode it looks keep building unauthentic story , further nanu character gets diagnosis of vascular dementia for which surgery is being done (where the hell you get this treatment kabir das), as the episodes goes on they finds predictable links in one othet gangs with very known results , just anothef waste of time that too of 9 hrs ,This looks only hyped because of star cast , not the genuine content in curremt genera of genius ott films/tv.\n",
      "Review 19: A gripping crime drama by Raj and Dk. The makers showcased all the characters. The writers left us with good suspenseful ending leaving us waiting for next season. The Plot was set clearly on counterfeiting scams which the writers has executed perfectly. The actors has done their roles perfectly. Sunny(Shahid Kapoor)and Firoz (Bhuvan Arora)bromance,Sunny-Megha(Raashi Khanna) on Screen chemistry worked. Michael Vedanayagam( Vijay Setupathi) has done an excellent work with his timing and mannerisms. Mansoor Dalal (Kay Kay Menon) has done his part with comedy-serious Character. The makers couldn't get a better screen presence for Regina Cassandra And Kubbra Sait,could have great presence in next season. There are some reference connecting The Family Man series. Overall,a great watch..\n",
      "Review 20: Very far ahead of the competition. Excellent. Not a single moment of dullness. Very few series are like this. Usually most series are first copy of some other series. But this was pure original. If we such entertainers than truly there would be less drug and porn addiction. Lack of such high entertainers cause people to look for something more entertaining. Thank you to the makers of this series. Excellent. Too Good, I am sure a crime was prevented some where because the criminal was too engrossed in watching this series. Some body did not take their daily dose of drugs because he or she was busy watching this series. Rashi Khanna is a new star, she was simply too good. Sahid was excellent. In fact all the stars were too good. Vijay in his unkempt look was fabulous. Amol always great. Kay Kay looking dashing , Bhuvan well done man. When will the next season be released. Great story, really thrilling. Worthy of your precious time. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Review 21: This plot seems to be copied from the book \" Who painted my money white\" by Sree Aiyer. Looks like the author has not been his due credit. Bollywood seems to have been bankrupt in new ideas and depends on south movies and plagiarism for its so called creation.I really feel that unless due credit is not given then we must not be acknowledging the series Amazon Prime itself is selling this book on its platform as no.1 best seller why is it doing this? It should have the right process in place to give due credit to the author. Maybe I am a stickler for ethics or just a romantic at heart for wishing fairness for all.#AmazonPrime should you not be looking into this?\n",
      "Review 22: I really enjoyed this series of FarziShahid kapoor was fabulous like always he's dialogue delivery was great like him actingAlso entire actors good in this seriesClimax was good I must say Raj & DK made very nice series like the family man I really appreciate that well made Raj & DKDialogues & story touch my heart today after watching Farzi because suspense are great all episodes made awesome i think public should be feel great after watch Farzi ... So guys go an watch Farzi an enjoy this series of FarziI would like to rate this series 10/9 because I really enjoyed itI'm waiting for season 2.\n",
      "Review 23: Farzi is a great show done by the same guys who made family man . The storyline is very gripping and has its twists and turns . Shahid Kapoor and especially the new guy Arora have done a great job.I am a big fan of Vijay sethupathi and this is his first foray into Hindi . I thought the first few episodes he was struggling then he really came into that groove . Liked his love hate relationship work the Minister Gahlot in the series .Overall and great series to watch and can't wait for the sequel and the story is at a interesting mode end of E8.Amol Palekar who plays the role of shadid Kapoor grand father is also a great addition to the cast .\n",
      "Review 24: One of the best Indian web series after a long time. Vijay and Shahid killed it in their roles. The story grips you right from the start and never lets you go. The final episode ended on a cliff hanger and I can't wait to see the next season. This series is linked to The Family Man and there is a surprise for The Family Man fans. I see a bigger universe in making. Raj and DK have once again delivered a great thriller. The character of arch of each lead characters is something that the directors have portrayed comprehensively. There is hardly a loose end in the series. There are many morally grey areas for every Character excerpt for one. The episodes are longer but totally worth it. Screenplay, script and direction are all top notch and too the point.\n",
      "Review 25: Be it Phenomenal Acting, Crisp Background Score, Comic Timing, Action towards the End, Well, Farzi has got it all. Shahid Kapur - Take a Bow. He has time and again proven that he is among the finest actors in the World and not just in India. Brilliant Story, Imaginative Direction by RAJ & DK, Stunning Camera Work and a Stellar Star Cast make Farzi a must watch. Shahid Kapur maintains his tremendous screen presence throughout and lights up the screen (Pun Unintended) whenever he is on. A special mention to Vijay Sethupathi who is a sheer delight with his Acting Genius and Comic Timing. Finally Kay Kay Menon who reigns supreme with his Comic Timing and Aura. What a splendid series. Throughly enjoyable !!!!\n",
      "Review 26: Nodays all Hindi webseries portraiting Indian officer's family drama and Chaos. A RBI employee became defence officer. She investigate like a intelligence officer and went to field job rather they have other qualified female officers for field job. If forgot that sit webseries is very good...there is comedy, thriller, Action, suspense. Actors did there job nicely. Vijay sir made his role real and interesting. Shahid did his best job for that webseries. A 10 second hidden Cameo also did well...New consept, well managed but only RBI employee became defence officer and Indian defence officer's family Chaos was not good.And last officer's family drama similar to \"The Family Man\" and Ajay Devgan's \"Rudra: the edge of darkness\".\n",
      "Review 27: #FarziOnPrime is very average! The biggest flaw is the casting. The cop vijay Sethu Pathi is so bad. Horrible editing and the show is so long. Family scenes, unwanted back story! Good story line destroyed by bad direction and cast!There was no need to show any slow moving scenes or scenes which had no connection to the original plot. They could have made it tight, and few episodes.The show was about fake notes where the focus moves out so soon.Kay Kay Menon and shahid are stars good acting. Again shahids baby's health and all those scenes were not required at allOverall a fail,, nothing new ! Can be surely missed.\n",
      "Review 28: What a show! Wonderful to watch how they portrayed their friendship part. Sunny and Firoz friendships rocks with Anees. Vijay Sethupathi totally justify his big name. One of his brilliant work but I believe he can deliver more like Master & Vikram. He and Zakir(one of the best actor in India) got a deadly combo. Shahid was absolutely amazing as always...all the time I wanted his win. And I've no words to describe the stylish Kay Kay. First time Rashi Khanna got a chance to show her talent. I was use to loved her cuteness all the time. I'm eagerly waiting for the second season of Farzi. Just Love the show....\n",
      "Review 29: Finally something good is being made I wish they can make season 2 soon we can't wait to watch what happens next step by step maybe Nana ji is still alive and will artist go after the villain or get arrested, suspense after another we need good shows like this. Rather than dirty stuff this show has non , it reminds of the movie kameny of shahid kapur same to same vibes. I finished the season today and wished 2nd was available to watch but we will have our fingers crossed for next one this year sooner or later. Its way better then movies now a days which start and end in 2 hours makes us guess what's going on.\n",
      "Review 30: This series could have been something else if the makers would have casted a more sincere actor instead of Shahid. He arrogance and false overconfidence just ruins his character beyond repair. Good thing is the other actors are in top form, the directors show how good a grip they have on this webseries format.Bollywood's overhyped actors like Shahid, Varun, Siddarth, Vicky, RajKumar, Ayushman etc. Who have no recent performance at the box office are about to get badly exposed even as far as their acting is concerned.This OTT format will create a lvl playing field and these overpaid actors will be shown the mirror.\n",
      "Review 31: I tried hard but couldn't avoid noticing the similarity with \"Breaking bad\". I didn't hate this one, but surely I wouldn't rate it very high.The dialogues and script could have been better, I feel. Acting department also needs work. We have established actors, but it doesn't do justice. We expect more from the likes of Shahid and KK Menon. They need better dialogues and writing.Many loop holes such as the chase scene at the end - how could the police Not plan any unit at the exit gates of the Mall to stop them from slipping away like that ?!I hope next season will be better. Looking forward to it. Good to see our filmmakers trying to take the best from the west and not just simple copy -paste. :)\n",
      "Review 32: Shahid has capability to star a big project . He is always under rated before chutiya actors but must say from udta punjab, kabir singh, pandmavat, jerery , to Fazi he is upgrading his level... Classic acting im his huge acting fan ... Im kind of person i dont follow single actor if you act well then ok otherwise bcz of actor i dont watch... But with shahid we shud take chance... I dnt knw why jeresy was not a block buster... Here game is different but i must say .. work like gem you will become legend mark my words... Bcz new generation is not puppet to follow like stupid ppl they will glorify if you act well... Shahid your dialogue delivery to presence make a mark on audience heart..\n",
      "Review 33: Vijay Sethupathi is an ocean of talent, and the actor once again gives a spectacular performance in the show. He is very intense as the task force officer, and the impact couldn't have been better if some other artist had played it. His comedy timing is sure to tickle your funny bones. Vijay Sethupathi's scenes with the Central Minister entertain big time. His antics and mannerisms are blissful to watch.Shahid Kapoor, as Sunny knocked it out of the park. Shahid is the soul of Farzi, around whom the entire plot revolves. Be it comedy, emotion, action, or romance, the actor gave it his all. Shahid looks terrific in the show, and he surely will get terrific applause for his acting. Moreover, the makers have touched upon a few social elements through Shahid's character. Special mention to Bhuvan Arora, who played Shahid's buddy.Raashii Khanna plays a very crucial role, and she is stunning in it.\n",
      "Review 34: Ok sorry for comparing with breaking bad, but just focus on story it's totally amazing. Concept was clear but logical answers is what we need to convince our mind that whatever we are watching can be possible to happen. I'm giving it 9 star, why not 10 because last scene is life of overall picture/web_series and I wondered why the last scene was VFX made and it's a bad VFX (if i can understand it's bad VFX then director can definitely understand) from next season please make scenes look closer to real, make things look killingly badass. Talking about cast vijay and shahid cool, speechless, mind blowing. And hats off to the writer.\n",
      "Review 35: My! My! Shahid Kapoor! He is no stranger to serious characters and realistic acting but this time he went all in. I think that Shahid Kapoor is the most underrated actor of Bollywood. He is most highly skilled actor in the film industry. This show is a beauty. Amazing Cinematography (expect a few wonky bits), Best Screenplay that I have seen yet, Great Humour and Fantastic Acting. The casting of this show was also pretty well done. It was nice to see South Indian actor being integrated in The Northern Film Industry. I am also a big fan of this plot. I think it could have been more interesting but I am fine with it. The suspense is real and well done. Also props to KK Menon. It felt so dramatic every time he was on screen. I loved it. This show is wonderful! 9/10! A Refreshing and Well Done Thriller!\n",
      "Review 36: God! After family man series, Raj and DK brought one more thriller stroy infront of us. The story starts from basic level and 1st episode is almost focused on Sunny character, the built best foundation for that character was totally worth it. Hands off the Vijay Shethupathi Sir work in it. The struggle of speaking Hindi shown best but the character didn't get proper screen time to connect that character. Overall all the character had work best of it. Mansoor character hopping we can actually see him more brutal in next season. Overall i can say watching all episodes was worth it totally and God if u loved Family series, you gonna love this also. Even though the concept is different but there is thrilled which may make heart beat fast. So without thinking any thing else, just watch it.\n",
      "Review 37: This is one of a kind series with such talented cast and amazing director's . The story is about an artist who is tired of the system and differentiation between poor and rich and wants to make a mark on this world . With a lot of twist and turns ,alot of comedy and thrill, this one is definitely one of my favourite, gave me alot of breaking bad vibes. The songs and background are so catchy, Shahid kapoor literally outshines like a bright diamond, even at his silence he acts like a completely different person , we genuinely feel like we are watching sunny not shahid kapoor. All other cast are equally amazing ,bhuvan arora, vijay, kay kay menon, raashi khanna , zakir hussain are such a strong characters, overall i had a blast. Get your pop corn ready because this one is a hell of a ride.\n",
      "Review 38: The series is slow to start but Shahid's acting and Setupathi's intensity will blow you off in the last two episodes. I didn't like the cast at the start but they flourish as the series progresses and you will find it worth your time.All the actors have been put in great performances but special mention goes to Firoz aka Bhuvan Arora for his Performance.Raj & DK have put up another stunner; trust me it's a great weekend binge if you're ready to tolerate the buildup of the first 3-4 episodes.And I'm quite stoked about the future seasons as Raj & DK will merge Family Man with this series. Watch out for Chelam sir!\n",
      "Review 39: I recently watched the web series Farzi and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed! The show has a unique and captivating storyline that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The acting is top-notch, with each cast member delivering outstanding performances. The cinematography is visually stunning, adding an extra layer of excitement to the already thrilling plot.The show masterfully blends humor, drama, and action to create an enjoyable and memorable experience. I appreciated the attention to detail in every aspect of the series, from the costumes to the music.Overall, I would give Farzi a 9 out of 10 rating. If you're a fan of web series and looking for something fresh and exciting, this is definitely a show you need to check out.Highly recommend!\n",
      "Review 40: The final episode of this show is truly a spectacle to behold. From heart-pumping action sequences to unexpected plot twists, you won't be disappointed. The buildup to this grand finale may seem slow, but it's all part of the master plan. So, while you might find yourself yawning during the earlier episodes, rest assured that it's all leading up to an unforgettable finale. I noticed that Shahid kapoor struggled to connect emotionally with the character they were portraying and his act was coming across as too pale like deliberately trying not to act. This lack of facial expression made it difficult for me, as the audience member, to fully engage with the character's journey.\n",
      "Review 41: Sheer brilliance.. Vijay and his dialect ..his chemistry with the Mr Gahlot. Just wow. Shahid is intense. Industry can witness next circuit as Feroz. Rashi khanna is very persistent bug to play around so smoothly. K k menon as always does magic . Coupled with master story tellers of modern era...Raj and DK.Chase story interwoven across boundry have been speciality of this director duo. It is gripping, convincing, entertaining and shocking at the same time. Good to see Mr palekar putting up some stability else every other character is on money run of their life. Totally bingeworthy and refreshing.\n",
      "Review 42: An engaging watch, each character is built with their presence on screen and it reveals layer by layer as the story moves. The super-cop Vijay Sethupathi is so natural in his character that he killed it, his scenes with minister and one liners are so cool. I am his new fan now. KK menon is another gem, he brings a genuineness in over the top characters, and finally Shahid Kapoor, well as I observed his over all film career, he is like onion, every movie, he demonstrates a new layer, this show his character is like that, he reveals himself layer by layer and series finale is at another level, again this is Shahid's one of the best performance.\n",
      "Review 43: Cinematography is a strong suit here, but it falls short in delivering in other ways.Stealing is apparently really easy for these newbies, and just as easily they are able to get one of the largest projects from a really big player overseas.If they're taking inspiration from breaking bad, they should have made a longer series taking us through how each step got them closer to a bigger scam. But everything came quickly, and fell down with the same speed.The main duo is funny, and acting is decent overall.The connection to family man is intriguing, and will definitely pull eyes for a second season.\n",
      "Review 44: What an exceptionally brilliant series. The character layers of all the actors were incredible and the character build up of Shahid Kapoor was incredible. The storytelling, writing and direction was spot on and icing on the cake was dialogues. One of the best series to come out from India in a long time. Last I saw something that was so good was Patallok. Vijay Setupati is fantastically brilliant. K K Menon has a charm of his own. And the friendship between Sunny & Firoz is simply heart touching. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch a good show. Also, give it a couple of episodes as it starts off slow to set the premise for a thrilling ride.\n",
      "Review 45: Mr. Vijay Sethupati the show steeler of this show. The best thing when he use to communicate in Hindi that was the best part. Shahid nk doubt one of the finest actor on Indian cinema he is loke old Bourbon the more you keep in barrel more stronger it becomes, Shahid has always been neglected as an actor people think he is that chocolaty boy still with baby face and smile, but ther is a massive amount of talent behind that baby smile. Then comes Bhuvan Arora his performance was worth watch, haha ludacris and Ldacris lagega tu üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüòÇ. This guy literally nailed and stood out. And at the end Raj&DK best series creators of India. They are like Vince Gilligan of India. Bringing realty to cinema.\n",
      "Review 46: Raj & DK did it again by giving another amazing series with an engaging nail biting thriller. Concept of this series is totally unique. We have seen and heard stories like this but never seen a depth and well researched fake money story and this series gives you a powerful screenplay with this story.The selling point of this series is the Performance of the cast. Superb.. Kay Kay, Shahid, Vijay all are excellent and gives a powerpact performance and keep the series alive till the end. Screenplay is gripping but it could've been shorter because there are some scenes which is stretched and could've easily trimmed but as for the series you can easily neglect that part because of the tight screenplay and cliffhanger climax which is a bit interesting. Raj & Dk is a master when it comes to this type of stories and presentation and they literally did it again. Give it a try it's an 8 hr series but you won't be disappoint...\n",
      "Review 47: The script is tight at a superb pace. The twists are clever without being contrived. The characters are mostly strong and some very good performances. While you face a stellar cast one must give credit to Bhuvan Arora, Raashi Khanna and Saqib Ayub who breathed a life into their characters that was beyond compelling!While this is a thriller with generous amounts of not over the top action, The writers spend enough time building out the back story for the lead characters so you can connect with them.This is in that cost class of television where Bollywood is out running Hollywood.Superb television - can't wait for them to make part 2!\n",
      "Review 48: All over series is so good..Bt Only vijay sethupati's input is wrong.. specially his language.. if doing dubbing of his voice than good.We can't listen clearly his dialogues..shahid Kapoor's dialogue delivery is too good..after long time i have seen his acting is perfect compare to his personality.i like 2 scene is too good..That container in see and that mall scene..after long time i have seen his acting is perfect compare to his personality.i like 2 scene is too good..That container in see and that mall scene..after long time i have seen this type of webs series..i wish that part 2 is also good like season 1..\n",
      "Review 49: This web series could be the beginning of the complete transition from traditional cinema to web series. It has a crisp screenplay and phenomenal direction that could keep a person like me (who gets bored watching movies even in cinema hall) completely glued to the screen for almost 8 hours. The first instance where I binge watched a web series. I am now super excited for the release of season 2.All the characters are well played by their respective 'Artists'. Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi and the rest of the star cast have given exceptionally good performance. Enjoyed all the 8 episodes and there was hardly any scope of using the forward button üòä\n",
      "Review 50: I loved it. Edge of the seat thriller. Shahid and vijay sethupathi were very apt for both roles. Both have done full justice. The friend role feroz is a show stealer and gives the much needed comic relief in this otherwise serious web series. No sensor no b.s that what made the show even more surreal. I highly recommend giving it a watch. It's got it all sentiments.. humor ...thriller ...suspense you name it you got it. I don't think bollywood ready for vijay sethupathi he came with a banging debut expecting much more from him soon . Shahid aging like fine wine. Give it a watch you will enjoy it.\n",
      "Review 51: My first take would be Farzi is a good show. But the makers could have easily completed the series in one season. It's unnecessarily dragged for second or maybe they might make a third season. Adding a couple of episodes and ending it here would make sense. Now we only have to watch the revenge of Sunny in the next season which is useless. Nowadays Indian OTT shows are getting converted to big budget mega action soap operas. And to mention all characters are played well. They have given their best to the role. The plus point is the characters chosen to play all roles. Overall a good watch for a weekend.\n",
      "Review 52: Rags to riches crime stories are pretty common, as hubris before the fall, cautionary tales. But Farzi is a gripping addictive drama that does not relinquish you one bit over 8 savage episodes. One cannot help feeling sympathetic to our protagonist 'The Artist' played so brilliantly by a passionate, idealistic Shahid Kapoor. Many can relate to the desire of the poor to succeed, no matter the ethical or moral cost. As he famously says \"Even I do not know what I am capable of.\" On the diametric opposite is Vijay Sethupathi, playing a drunk detective driven to hunt down counterfeit currency by any means. A very entertaining cat, mouse and lion game. The cliffhangers in the last few minutes of the season finale left me begging for a 2nd season.\n",
      "Review 53: Masterclass story and amazing line of cast. Very interesting and engaging from beginning till the last frame. Fun involved and builds curiousity all along. Background score is also catchy all the time increasing curiousity. Expecting an action packed season soon.Raj & DK thank you so much for the entertainment. Every character has its own significance. Waiting for next season.The crossover from the other series is crazy and this increasing more expectation over the next season. Extrorodinary show of actiong from Vijay Sethupathi, Shahid Kapoor, Kay Kay Manon and each and every one of them. #Raj&DK Jai hind.\n",
      "Review 54: Farzi delivers a brand new concept for the audience which makes it exciting to watch . Very rarely we come across with such a well scripted series & not to forget the cast too . Everybody did their job so well .It's very difficult to strike a balance when there are so many good actors & I must admit the makers did their jobs well . Every character in this show has got importance . What wonderful acting by Shahid Kapoor & Rashi Khanna though I have seen her work for the first time she really did a fantastic jobEvery aspect of this show is intriguing filled with masala , some comedy , action & thrills . One will really get addicted to series as the episodes will pass by.\n",
      "Review 55: It's mind blowing ..oh my god what a series ..it's truly a combination of the brilliant actors all over .. Raj & Dk combined them together to create a masterpiece .. First of all the favourites Vijay Sethupathi he is truly a brilliant actor ..he acted really well then one the best actors of the Bollywood Shahid Kapoor he always gives his best but this time it's his best performance ever..Then Bhuvan Arora also acted well how we shows their bond between them is nice ..and then Zakir Hussain , Kay Kay Menon and Rashi Khanna they all did their job brilliantly..know we know that how can we create a masterpiece Thank You Raj &Dk.\n",
      "Review 56: One of the best performances by shahid, Vijay &KK Sir awesome webseries i recommend to watch i am just thinking this webseries deserves more then 10 stars best webseries of this year awesome. Unbelievable story truely out of the box we just bored watching the webseries that are similar to each other i just binge watched this each and every character bring his own charm and the way each and everyrole has important role is just incredible 3 big stars equal level of role distribution and each and everyone has there own values truely amazing. KAY KAY sir just unbelievable vijay brings his own charm and shahid now a days selection of movies and now the web series is just incredible.\n",
      "Review 57: Mind blowing series after very long time...top notch screen play...plot was engaging..makers have brought something different story line other than usual terrorism ( we all got bored of seeing same terrorism drama in every series) but this is really different..it compelled the viewer to think that wats going to b next..dialogues and acting of every character is on another level..loved Shahid , K K Menon and Nanu ( Amol Palekar) sir..and can't ignore Vijay Sethupati..his dialogue delivery in hindi sounds so cute..Chittranjan Giri's character was also impressive..one cud feel seeing him as if our own chacha is trying to show us the right path..makers have bought artists from every film making industry of India..Bhuvan Arora to nailed it with his acting skills..Kudos to team...Super hit2nd season is surely anticipated üëèüëèüòä\n",
      "Review 58: Watching the acting has been great. I adored Vijay's acting, his ability to master accents, and the way he delivered Shahid's lines. New tale, excellent acting, and powerful blows.The narration is incredibly clear, cohesive, and well-crafted. I watched something unfussy and natural for the first time in a very long time. The director personally selected each person for their position and made the greatest impression possible. From Chachu to Firoz to Nanu to Kay Kay, every character has lived up to their expectations. You must see this if you want to see compelling performances and an exciting tale.Definitely and a MUST watch.\n",
      "Review 59: As of late, it takes a lot for me to get into a show/movie/series etc, however Farzi captivated my attention from the get go. Bhuvan and Shahid's chemistry as best buds is great to watch. Rashi, Kay Kay, Vijay have done a tremendous job in their roles. I enjoyed the storyline, and many scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. It was cool to see the process it takes to make bills look real! Shahid has proven himself in many roles before, but this is definitely one of his best! I really hope there is a season 2 that the cast is already working on, as I can't wait to see what is next for Sunny and Firoz.\n",
      "Review 60: After i started to watching reviews I want to watch this.but it went very well and I'm totally satisfied. After mirzapur this is the first series I'm satisfied in prime. Immersive and gripping screenplay to sit on seat edge experience. Happy to reviewing this as a Indian. Technical brilliance are completely dominated for production values of prime. Shahid Kapoor is the fame of this.I frequently watched Shahid films but i never expect this perfomance from him. I became fan of him. If you don't want h this you will miss a best series. It also shows how artists are demotivated from their goals. Do yourself a favour watch this.\n",
      "Review 61: Super or Superman, you decide!!! I have enjoyed this to the core and it is the most fun, most in marketed content that relies on the design of the artist involved. I know, nowadays projects are designed, but for something to feel organic is , then, I guess, art!! Why does anyone have to give up this slice of heaven? Amol palekar, they have amol bloody palekar in there! God!! They have kk Menon in there!!! Easter egg much?? The love that i feel for this project is just awesome. Its bingeable. But I want to keep it like hard candy. Something that i can suck on for days but still, it does not bloody suck!!!\n",
      "Review 62: Who told that indian webserise/movies can't compete Hollywood series ?This series just an example, The storyline thrilled enough to compete any world class series like Breaking bad, Narcos, Money Heist,Peaky Blinders, Ozark. All characters acted so well, No dual plots, no unnecessary sex scenes and most importantly a grounded take on crime of counterfeiting.After so long #Prime has made a masterpiece.I'm sure you Can't move in front of the TV untill the end,All credit goes to Krishna DK and Raj & more than that Shahid kapoor , Vijay setupathi & KK Menon just nailed it.Welldone üî•üî• Team \"Farzi\"üëçüëçüëç\n",

A well paced story without being slow.

      "Review 64: The show is just awesome. Shahid is great. The story is engaging and keeps you on the edge throughout. KK Menon nailed it. The show almost never gets boring and does not drag. Only Sethupathi is horrible. It feels like he is just reading the script. No acting and zero emotions. His scenes are the only boring part. Nevertheless, it is one of the best show in 2023. I already can not wait for the next season. I finished the whole series in one go. Although there are 8 episodes almost 1 hour long, the story is interesting throughout. Awesome work. One can watch it again and again and again and again.\n",
      "Review 65: Things i didn't like in this series1. Neither Protogonist nor antagonist are powerful. They behave like a little less matured.2. Not memorable characters. You don't remember them after completion of series. In family man and mirzapur, you remember and connect to every character3. Throwing money out of van and that love scenes b/w actor and actress is copied from money heist.4. Vijay is a veteran actor. Not used his talent much . He talks and behaves like a Buffon and what the hell is his telugu dubbing?? Not suitable at all5. I love watching web series more than movies because in web series, we'll see character transformation, memorable characters, actors behaviour under some situations,twists, cliffhangers for every episode. Most importantly we connect to Protogonist or antagonist . That's missing here6. And love track feels forced. Chemistry between actor and actors feels mechanical.\n",

Shahid always underrated unfortunately but did his best as always. Story is something new and looks real. I finished all the parts in one go, couldn't wait to see conclusion. Please keep us updated on the 2nd season. There is lot much expected in 2nd part. They made triangle üìê in the story and it will add lot of fun. Please try to add more violence by adding some characters like Vijay. Also please try to bring a new actress for Vijay :)\n",

Not just the accent but the way he speaks is so funny. Last but not least, Zakir Hussain and his skills. So Natural and it's really great to see his scenes. The story is so good and direction is absolutely perfect. I am glad I have decided to watch FARZI. The last episode was unexpected. They way they took Sunny's character is really unexpected and it's was WOOW moment to experience it. Desperate waiting for season 2.\n",

Every detail here is explained perfectly even if details won't be 100 percent accurate but it seems to be. No overacting, well written dialogues. Amazing cast. In the end all you need is to watch this amazing series. Used bit of abusive words but I think that is required to give aroma of the situation. All characters played amazing role specially the villain(made us laugh, made us hate him). Very good link for making 2nd season. I hope this info doest help people to make fake currency üòÅ\n",

But the story does not end to it we have K K menon best sarcastic villain from bollywood...Just loved the show the concept and everything this has something different from all thee other series..Sony liv once tried to make a similar series but they could not showcase it very well the way prime has released there FARZI.\n",
      "Review 72: Owesome masterpiece after a long time. A superb performance by Sahid. Farzi is another award winner,\" the fan quipped. Screenplay and dialogues in the series are crisp and that Kay Kay Menon and Shahid Kaooor have delivered exceptional performances.\"Another good series by Raj and DK. You will not able to blink your eyes from your screen. You will stuck in your chairs. Casting is very good Amol Palekar. A dream cast of Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi and Kay Kay Menon at the top of their game. Brilliant performances by a terrific ensemble. \"Farzi\" pushes its luck from the off with its uncommonly generic, get-rich-or-die-trying plot. After his grandfather's left-wing newspaper folds, struggling Mumbai artist Sunny (Bollywood pin-up Shahid Kapoor) repurposes a printing press to churn out counterfeit banknotes.\n",
      "Review 73: \"Farzi\" is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end. The series features an all-star cast, led by Shahid Kapoor, Kay Kay Menon, and Vijay Setupati, who deliver powerful performances that will leave you in awe. The storyline is a perfect blend of action, suspense, and humor, making the show a must-watch for anyone who loves a good crime drama. The production value is top-notch, and the cinematography is simply stunning. Farzi is a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will keep you on the edge. Overall, it's a well-crafted and highly entertaining series that is sure to leave a lasting impression.\n",
      "Review 74: Worth watching the story! Shahid has done very natural acting! KK Menon OMG he is the charm of this series... Vijay Sethupati is great as always but could have improved his HINDI Accent. Rashi Khanna Looks beautiful. Add glamour to the whole series. Good to see Amol Palekar Sir after a long time. Coming to the screenplay, you will stick to each and every moment in the whole series as every moment is important, especially the moment when Shahid was talking to his EX that why can't be truthful to the people we love the most. His Friend is the friend we all need in life. Always with you whether its right or wrong. Started waiting for the next season right from the next moment. I hope RAJ & DK won't make us wait for 2 years.SPOILER ALERT : There can be a multiverse for Vijay Sethupati & Manoj Bajpayee.\n",
      "Review 75: Farzi is a masterpiece, outstanding and mustwatch web series. It has been well written. Even the minute details of fake currency and smuggling have been taken care of. It is one of the best crime thriller. When you start watching it, you will finish the whole season in one sitting. All the actors have done justice to their respective characters. But Shahid Kapoor and Kay Kay Manon were the best for their roles. They did very well. The season ended with a thrilling climax. I knew it was going to end, yet I wished it shouldn't. Now, I am waiting for the 2nd season and hoping for a better sequel.\n",
      "Review 76: Out of surprise, did I just watch a Indian web series. Amazingly done. Kudos to the whole team ! Such a vibe, this series contains all. It's quite contained in all areas and a perfect drama. I did not feel even once that the story moved out of the content. Each character is portrayed well, screenplayed well and even handpicked the right talents to create this masterpiece. From episode 1 to 8 there is absolutely no fillers and it's purely a package to those who are waiting for a Indian masterpiece. I am eagerly waiting for season 2 just after watching season 1. This is definitely a game changer !!\n",
      "Review 77: This is my first review ever on IMDB because I didn't feel like posting a review earlier for any other series. Farzi is just out of this world, fabulous story, realistic, superb turn of events and a mind blowing crime series to watch. Shahid never fails to surprise, this time he has done it with a brand new web series, infact his best friend in the series Firoz has also done a great job. I am eagerly waiting for the 2nd season. This has to come out this year itself.. pls. Wowww. Must watch guys.Also the police officer and that minister, they do a great job adding funny elements with their banter from time to time.\n",
      "Review 78: Good characterisation, good screenplay and storyline. In all everything works out well for this Shahid Kapoor starrer with anmol Patekar again giving hi share of excellence.to the role. Fans of the veteran actor are in awe of his skills to emote and enact. It's a privilege to watch him again on screen. Shahid Kapoor does justice with his role as a struggler and then as an ace player.of wits. He along his co actor have taken the story very smoothly till the close. No scene gives the impression of saturation point and the drama unfolds slowly but continuously for the viewers. Without getting into the ehtical aspect of the crime, it's the way the crime has been given effect to and how a person as naive as the characters get involved and encharmed by it , that catches the eye of the viewers. Good watch.\n",
      "Review 79: Wonderful to watch how they manage all the characters. Shahid Kapoor and Vijay Sethupathi done amazing job. Sethupathi never failed to deliver the best version. Raj and DK done a tremendous job. Kay Kay Menon was awesome as always the stylish man. Zakir Hussain what an actor India got. Rashi Khanna the beautiful lady. Amazingly done the work. Screenplay, dialogue, storytelling, editing everything was on the top. Sunny and Firoz always fun to watch them together with Aness also. What a thinking! A must watch thrilling story. Narration was so good.I'm eagerly waiting for the second season of Farzi. Just Love the show....fabulous.\n",

Action , love, Joking, spying whatever everything looks perfect. Money is everything in today's world. So please make another season as soon as possible. We are waiting.

      "Review 81: With so many great things, there are some perplexing angles!1. Lack of good sketch artists and any intent to use them. The investigation team could have used a good sketch artist with the Guj MLA. May be he denied ever seeing them? The team wasn't bothered much about using mobile CDR or location to narrow down the search ever.2. The sketch artist Vijay dealt with later was pathetic. I mean Vijay saw the guys from a couple of feet in broad daylight and still the sketch was bull****.3. Why the lady officer was allowed in the SUV. She was a rookie with at least 1 known case of insubordination and rashness. And still she is allowed without any known reason at the most critical time in a super important case!\n",

Mansoors in Thailand why dont he puts him Handcuffs first instead he sat infront of him chitchatting, if he was handcuffed at the back he would not have any opportunity to run . Whereas in Metalist the first thing FBI does is Handcuffs any suspects.A very small but key working difference seen in working of RAW vs CBI.Does writer purposely created a seen in the story so that Mansoor runs away and then Michael chases Minister for a dedicated team for the mission. Whereas Michael was having a team of 4 which is enough as per FBI team shown in the mentalist. May be there is some reason behind Mansoor's escape.\n",
      "Review 83: OH my mY what an awesome script writer has written; Director choose the top actors/actress for the series. Not for a single second my eyes were out of the screen. Superb direction,ALL the actors were top notch. The side roll part actor killed it. So less song which is also a good part of the series.Director did work hard ; & with hard work work comes great casting and all were here ; you will fill curious after every part of watching .After A long time shahid kapoor finally gives us a fabulous spark of his talent .So GO grab your own fav snacks and drinks watch it -Super recommended .!\n",
      "Review 84: It is slow paced and I will suggest waste of time as it has become a habit of Raj &DK to keep the web series ending in limbo. The narration drags multiple times with unrequired deviation. Yasir doing the same thing multiple times does not seem real and I will be blunt but Shahid is too stoned to act here. A better actor would have done a better job than the star. Likeable acting by Vijay S, Rashi Khanna, Zakir Hussain. KK would have been superb and I wish his role would have had better described. Coming from Raj &DK after family man 2 (series 1 was again too many deviations from a thriller), I had high expectation here. Go watch Special Ops 2 and you will love it.\n",
      "Review 85: A crime drama written and directed as much of an art. Brilliant acting from all the characters. Never knew Shahed Kapoor could be this good. Vijay Sethupathi nails it. Supportive characters are too doing their maximum. Undoubtedly the best Indian TV series in the recent past. If you enjoyed Money Heist and the professor, there is a high chance you would like the Artist. As a hindi movies fan very happy to see that indian cinema brings this quality stuff to TV series. The way it ended at the final episode, felt that there will be a second season coming soon. Overall a great to watch thoroughly enjoyable storyline.\n",
      "Review 86: The star cast is good but they don't come across as appealing. Shahid's acting feels monotonous with only few good scenes, Vijay Sethupathi tries his best but the character is not written well and also his Hindi diction comes across as off-putting, his scenes with the minister though entertaining at first, feel repetitive during later episodes. Bhuvan arora,Amol palekar, rashi khanna and rest of the cast seem good and used appropriately.Some parts of the series are technically good but there are a lot of plot holes and believability issues.I hope they don't make a season 2 and if they do Raj&DK should make a better attempt at writing it.\n",
      "Review 87: Heavy weight characters such as Amol jee, Vijay Sethupathi, Kay Kay, Manoj would compel viewer from any walk of life but to see Shahid growing into character as an artist i.e. Exhilarating both to the subject and the object of its experience is astounding!! Finally, the kid has grown .. GBY!! Finally, every cast member is devoted to some of the basic truths on which the esoteric edifice \" Indian Art\" culture including aesthetic principles in their application to drama can be experienced. I wont say a word for Pankaj :) He is master of Indian Art and Drama.. It reminds me of all great artistic work proceeds from an act of intuition, not really an intellectual idea or a splendid imagination but a direct intuition of some thruth of life or being. It is a pleasure watching these characters are able to evoke or thoughts necessary to the greater greatness and the highest perfection... Congratulations to director, script writer and entire team such a delight!!\n",
      "Review 88: First half of the season is boring , could have been lesser episodes .Thought writer have written original story but similar to Rush Hour 2 storyline as well as buring note scenes copied directly .Not a Must Watch ...but Acting wise and for last 4 episodes you can watch .Something where irrelevant in the story. Hindi speaking part of the Vijay seems to be unnecessary as well his personal story without any proper back story of his personal life .Lastly you can watch it but not super duper hit wala story . Not great but yes good acting makes its bearable to watch such as acting of Kay Kay Menon .\n",
      "Review 89: The best! Binge-worthy in every waysuperior to a money heistWhat a series ended on a very good one, and Vijay Sethupathi is my all-time favourite actor. The entire casting, including Shahid Kapoor, is excellent. There isn't a bgm that sounds like a scam, but occasionally it feels like one. The acting, writing, and story are all of the highest calibre. K K Menon is especially excellent, which is funny considering I initially believed him to be the film's biggest villain. The Hindi dialogues by Sethupathi were excellent. The only difficulty i have with numerous series are nudity and profane language since it cant be viewable with family thank god nudity.\n",
      "Review 90: The real actor with all real hero's hard work... every team members play good roles...I have a habit of fast forwarding scenes but I tell you every single minute here counts..Vijay sethupathi is too good and hella natural actor all time favorite üíô what a series ended at a very good note.. Shahid kapoor is good as well whole casting is done brilliantly there is no bgm though like scam but here and there feels like its a scam lookalike Acting dialogue story everything is top notch K K menon is too good funny thing is i thought he is biggest villain but hella no upper hand on him is going to reveal in second part special mention Sethupathi dialogues in hindi were done brilliantly.\n",
      "Review 91: What a show!Amazing characters with complex backgrounds that come together. Season 1 was amazing. I can't believe this was an Indian show. This show is for sure for mature audiences. I could not stop watching this show and had to go to the next episode. Shahid Kapoor is an amazing actor. The script was well written, great directors, editors, with great suspense and comedy as well. A true picture of real India with no Bollywood music and dances. I can't wait for season 2 as season 1 was left at a cliff hanger. I have to say, all actors played their roles perfectly. Not a single character was out of line.\n",
      "Review 92: Mind blowing webseries I would say it's just ahes of its timeGood directionShahid Kapoor as always his acting & talent is just too good to watchI saw Vijay sethupati for the first time and i wonder why he is called legend of tollywood just natural actor he isKay Kay menon - don't have word for him my fav and natural actor i think he just read the script and go in one shot so easy for him to do soAll the small and co-actors are just nailed it and made the series so wonderful to watchRashi khanna - wow man bold & beautifulAmol palekar - still got the touchZakir Hussain - Minister role played by him is just too fab can't wait for season 2.\n",
      "Review 93: Outstanding direction & cinematography, very well executed storyline and plot, has you gripped in your seat from the first scene. The story focuses on key themes - Family, trust, ambition and greed bring about a hook that keep you magnetised to the screen. Think of similar Hollywood films and you would feel will this live up to the hype or is this a copy in any way. It's actually refreshing that this is an original series and not a Hollywood copy. The first season leaves a lot to be desired for future seasons.In short all The actors knocked it out the park.Credit to the creators and directors for this masterpiece. Binged it in one day #LovedITCan't wait for season 2.\n",
      "Review 94: Starting from its writing, execution, acting and more importantly captured the shots from beginning to end which keeps the viewer intact. I personally loved it big thumbs up to entire team for delivering this great series. However one must be wondering why my ratting is 9.Well that is for Mr. Vijay Sethupathi. He indeed a big name but here the role in this series, unfortunately he is not the best fit. His entire profile doesn't fits for that role (i.e: dialogue delivery, voice) is a big time disappointment. Again as i said he is a big name, big star but was not suitable for the role he played during this series.\n",
      "Review 95: Fantastic acting, great storyline, and perfect blend of humour. It never lets you get bored. Shahid Kapoor and KK Menon are just perfect in their roles. Vijay as the relentless cop, Rashi as a genius / nerd obsessed with counterfeiting, and Zakir Hussain as the unwilling but supportive minister provide a great backbone to the story.The backdrop of the story (counterfeit currency) is also new and hence many of the plots in the story are unique.As always, it is a drama, and it has some flaws, but nothing that reduces the authenticity of the effort, or the entertainment this series offers.I'll eagerly look forward to the second season.\n",
      "Review 96: One of the strengths of Farzi is its captivating storyline, which keeps the viewer engaged from beginning to end. The series is well-written and the pacing is spot on, never dragging but also not feeling rushed. The tension and suspense are expertly crafted, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat throughout each episode.The cast of Farzi is also a standout aspect of the series, with standout performances from Shahid, Vijay, Faraz and Kay Kay Menon. The chemistry between the characters is strong and their interactions are believable and engaging.Another strength of Farzi is its stunning visuals and attention to detail. The production values are high, with beautiful cinematography and well-crafted sets and locations.\n",
      "Review 97: Had such a great time binging this with friends. Never felt laggy and the performers were solid. The acting even from those short lived foreign actors was good. Solid cast overall and solid storyline. They even balanced out the flashbacks really well and made me care about daadu just enough not dragging the relationship part. The romance was also well balanced and showed a cute moment there just enough for me to not want either of them to get hurt and root for them and yet it didn't feel like it drifted off too much into the romantic side of it. It served its purpose and I also admire Vijay for learning Hindi to make his role of a South Indian inumbai seem more authentic. And as someone who is from the south i really liked when he'd go in a flow and speak in Telugu and tamil. Was like a little easter egg of the vjs that we love.\n",
      "Review 98: Farzi is perhaps the only title I've watched that has made me laugh lately and I'm surprised by how grounded it felt. There are no obvious loop holes I could find which is a first for me in a show as such and it is commendable at how the show has been fast paced yet there has been no overwatch on the dynamics of it all. Good fast paced story and a heart combination of the leads. The whole season although looks like a build up to the sheer fire within shahid Kapoor namesake. I must admit though that the climb is thoroughly enjoyable and definitely keeps you glued on. Can't wait for the next season. Must watch must binge.\n",
      "Review 99: After watching the trailer I thought they have revealed the story now what are they going to show in the episodes. But what a mind blowing story!!!! And the angles,lighting and the direction is totally entertaining !! Plus the dialogues are so well written. Waiting for Season 2.Shahid - Top Class ActingK. K. Menon - Toppest class actingBhuvan Arora - What an actor he is!!!!!Vijay Sethupati - Most natural and classy actor I have seen so farRashi Khanna - Her screen presence and the role that she is essaying has suited her perfectlyAnd all the other remaining characters have played a wonderful role!!!!\n",
      "Review 100: 10/10. After two successful seasons of The Family Man, there was interest and curiosity about what Directors Krishna DK and Raj Nidimoru would do next. Their film and television work has been unpredictable so far.In Farzi, they pull off the terrific casting of Amol Palekar, Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi and Kay Kay Menon, who provide good reasons to watch it.The subject is unusual but also a bit dry.Chasing terrorists and sundry enemies of the country is far more exciting than a currency counterfeiting operation, so the eight-part series has to be padded with family drama and emotional heart tugs.\n",
      "Review 101: Even though the series delivers on being a good thriller with visually striking action sequences and an equally engaging plot. I believe it fails to make full use of it's own premise, as the one thing which is at the centre of it's plot, counterfeit money. Can very well be replaced with any other counterfeit thing and little to no difference will be felt when it comes to the plot. Which is quite disappointing considering all the thematic implications that could've been introduced into the story, only if more time would've been spent on exploring the original premise for the series where the story was in service to it's characters and not the other way around.\n",
      "Review 102: The concept, Drama dialogue deliveries are absolutely eye catching. But the detailing is not that good specially where sensation is created.1. Scene where Megha found some counterfeit notes at a restaurant she didn't go for CCTV to find out who would have given it.2. She goes on raiding multiple press in surrounding but shows only Kranti press but after she finds something suspicious she doesn't doesn't try to find the owners and background of the press3. Micheal sees both sunny and Feroz but couldn't draw good sketch.. also doesn't try to ponder the CCTV of entrance or next block to get the good view of the picture.\n",
      "Review 103: Paisa hai toh üî•üî•üî•üî•Shahid Kapoor has *once again* became my favourite actor after this series. I am totally putting Farzi on a pedestal! I hope to see a crossover of the family man and farzi in the future that many people are talking about. Overall, loved shahid's OTT debut. I also saw Vijay sethupathi's work for the first time with this watch, I would definitely watch some of his past works in the South industry. He seems like a great actor. His casting is perfect for this role! The person who played the politician's role was also great.I am currently obsessed with the soundtracks of the series, Paisa hai toh is an absolutely LIT song.\n",
      "Review 104: Definitely gonna enjoy the Shahid Kapoor's acting loved it. Overall it's best binge for Bollywood fans who wanted to watch some unique content . Web series was great . Loved all performance of actors especially settupatti sir . Must watch. How money and the situation in life changes everything for man it gives the idea how the money laundering and fake money crashes the economy . Whole webseries dominated by the Shahid and settupatti sir and especially performance by actress is nice . Happy to see her in Bollywood web series that is rakhi khanaa . It is great gift for the Shahid fans because he met the belief of audience. Must binge it ...\n",
      "Review 105: To start with, the protagonist of the story, Shahid Kapoor delivered an exceptional performance - varied expressions, strong emotions, baffled experiences, it was all wonderfully acted out. Sethupathi, portrays a rather calmer character, deprived and battling with frustrations at various levels. I feel I craved for more strength and rage in his character but also enjoyed the witty and funny excerpts every now and then. Can't appreciate enough how Bhuvan Arora performed in this series. A stark contrast to Shahid's character, his role completes the duos success story. Expected a little bit of suspense and twist here and there which would have grossly added to the wow factor.\n",
      "Review 106: One of the best series They discovered the link to disseminate the cash, and then the fake cash started overwheeling in the city. Michael's character, Vijay Sethupathi, a law enforcement officer, is on a quest to eradicate all false corruption in the city. He is trying to identify the distributor's primary source. The remaining plot of the series revolves around whether or not he demolished, as well as how he destroyed.They discovered the link to disseminate the cash, and then the fake cash started overwheeling in the city.

      "Review 107: This is one of the best web series with some well known starts. Here is my rating -Direction - 8.5/10Background Music - 9/10Shaid Kapppor - 8.5/10KK Menon - 9/10Vijay Sethupati - 10/10Vijay Sethupati and Zakir Hussain (Minister)'s chemistry - 11/10.This is the perfect combination of artists from South India and from the Hindi Cinema. I had seen Vikram Vedha and Vikram of Vijay but here his level is altogether different.Credit also goes to other artist as everyone has given justice to their roles. The ending is also very good.Hindi cinema Industry should produce such kind of creation instead of trash movies with big names and unrealistic budgets.\n",
      "Review 108: Absolutely loved Farzi, a super refreshing and crispy series created by Raj & DK that not only nailed the plot and cinematography but also was very real in its emotions when it came to the plot, with characters bringing in depth of their own to the screen.Discovered Bhuvan Arora, absolute gem of an artist who left his presence on screen with his comic yet emotional quotient that was elevated by the chemistry he shared with Shahid Kapoor. It felt like both were indeed the best of friends. Kudos to Bhuvan for holding on to the nuances of his character till the very last scene. Certainly the finest cliffhanger of this year!\n",
      "Review 109: Show is another version of the existing series 'Family man'. There are underlying many similarities which includes showing a supercool policeman, adding south & north Indian flavor and much more. An Artist cannot be a so deep planner, executer, solely killing many people - it's another version of all in one HERO. Finally ending is also predicted/same. We need a step-up content. It's not bad but quite similar to what is already available in the market and thus it surely needs a different lens and purview of the situation. Performances are good especially the Firoz . It was difficult to hook up to the show but not bad.\n",
      "Review 110: Sahid Kapoor just nailed it. The character and plot development is too good, Detailing of plot is very tight, not a single place where we will feel boring. Binge worthy series. Kay Kay Menon just nailed it. He was very good. The script and screenplay both are remarkable. Setting a high bar for Bollywood web Series. Connection with The Family man is unexpected but damn good. There are so many jaw dropping and woo scenes. Eagerly waiting for the season two as it got over at a cliff hanger.Perfect depiction of middle class small scale artist. Dialogue delivery and humor timing of Vijay is too good.\n",
      "Review 111: Just because the creators of this have directed family man which I think is the best 10/10 web series from them, I wouldn't give this good rating as it's watchable series. Good to know how to tackle the black currency but it's not as engaging as Family man. Vijay sethupathi action was very very natural which doesn't work out sometimes, it has to be like Manoj little bit cinematic and dramatic. Dialogues are not the best like Family man. Divorce proceedings and Vijay and politician track are lame. No stunning moments at any time except few in the last few episodes. Over all I would give 5-6/10. Shahid Kapoor performed well overall and it's his show all the way. Vijay sethupathi was better in lot of Tamil movies but not in this.\n",
      "Review 112: A racy series and absolutely loved the way the scenes are written and connected. Simplicity of the series and characters are the best part, yet it engages with edge of the seat thrills. Cast is outstanding, Shahid lived in the role is an understatement and glad he picked this instead of a movie, this will live on for a long time. Now the country and globe witnesses what a talent Vijay sethupathi is, his scenes with the minister are a lit. Rashi has been exceptional in being strong yet vulnerable. Bhuvan Arora was superb and gets a career break and all the best series must have KK Menon to make them actually best.Keep it coming Raj & DK, you are creating a genre of its own and you are sure to take Indian series and creativity to another level.\n",
      "Review 113: Although starting is bit slow but later on it caught its pace and then moved on like a jet. Fantastic screenplay, superb punches and above all great acting. All have justified their character superbly. Let it be Nanu, chachu, Feroz or Mansoor or minister. Saheed Kapoor is as usual maintaining the legacy of his great father. Rashi Khanna is very cute and confident in her role. But above all Setupathi is inexplicable. What an amazing acting, superb dialogue delivery as well as heart touching expression. Six pack actors should learn! Overall after Familyman another Raj DK magic eagerly waiting for next season. Don't make us wait for a long.\n",
      "Review 114: Shahid Kapoor is too brilliant in this web series other caste also done well but shahid Kapoor was exceptional he superbly performed in this character nowadays this movie character shoots him superb and makes him too mature angry looking man.above all the story & script was mind blowing which makes every time thrilling.i must wait for second season..plzzz make the 2nd season offcourse with shahid Kapoor..I am earnestly Mr. Story writer do write again the second season. Anees((movie name) perhaps his name shoib was very good. Chapter 5.6.7.8 of this series was extremely thrilling which can't get handled also...\n",
      "Review 115: This is too good.. with so much of details they have done in the entire series. They have taken minute details and then shahid kapoor rocks again; after farzi, he rocks again in bloody daddy. The ending shows full scope for the second part, where the main characters will have encounter of shahid kapoor and vijay sethupati and then the actress will also come to know the reality of shahid kapoor. All in all, it has been a nice experience except the language part. It could have been made by reducing the abusive contents as well. Anyway, it has solved the purpose of entertainment thru web series..\n",
      "Review 116: I am literally aw-strucked. Kudos to the team of Farzi. Would definitely recommend to watch. Superb acting by all the cast, all the experience and the energy is devoted towards creating the master piece - Farzi. Raj & DK both the creators did fantabulous job. The script, story line, pace (not a single minute bored me), cast, adequate use of foul language, cinematography, the creation of that suspense throughout the series, and all in all the complete engagement, all at top level. I am eagerly waiting for the next season and would watch it as it get released. Guys do watch out this series, am sure you will definitely love it.\n",
      "Review 117: The series is full of twists and turns that keep the viewers hooked and guessing. The performances of the actors are superb, especially Shahid Kapoor and Vijay Sethupathi, who share a great chemistry and rivalry on screen. The supporting cast, such as Kay Kay Menon, Raashii Khanna, Bhuvan Arora, and Amol Palekar, also deliver impressive performances. The series also has a great soundtrack composed by Sachin-Jigar and Tanishk Bagchi, which adds to the mood and atmosphere of the show.Farzi is a must-watch series for fans of crime thrillers and black comedies. It is a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted series that offers a lot of fun and excitement. The series also has a cliffhanger ending that leaves the viewers wanting more. Farzi is one of the best Indian web series of 2023. I would rate it 10 out of 10.\n",
      "Review 118: Taking Indian Web Series To Next Level. This Show Is An Absolute Masterpiece . All The Characters Nailed Their Respective Roles .This Show Deserves So Many Awards. I Loved Every Episode And For Me This Is The Best Show I Have Ever Watched That Is Made In India There Are Also Many Masterpiece Webseries That Is Made In India Like Asur But This Is For Me The Best The Perfect Entertainment Package . All The Actor Actresses Nailed It Like Shahid Kapoor He Is One Of The Finest Actor Of Bollywood , Vijay Sethupathi The Actor Who Can Play Anyrole You Give Him (The Best) And Rashi Also Does A Brilliant Job And I Forgot To Say Bhuvan Arora What An Acting Done By Him Also. That's Why I Rated It 10 / 10 . I Am Loving The Show You Go Watch It You Will Never Regret Watching This Perfect Masterpiece.\n",
      "Review 119: I don't have words to start talking about this fantastic web series called Farzi. It has everything which needs for a super entertainment such as story line, cast, acting, dialogues, comedy, action, affection.The story is based upon counterfeiting notes (fake currency). Everyone including Sunny(Shahid Kapoor), Mansoor(Kay Kay Menon) played their characters brilliantly but Michael(Vijay Sethupathi) and Megha(Rashi Khanna) impressed me a lot personally. You'll enjoy every time whenever Michael opens his mouth to speak in hindi üòÖI really can't write more about it so just a suggestion to all that please go and watch this masterpiece as soon as possible.\n",
      "Review 120: What an outstanding show. The cast, the storyline, the cinematography, the visuals, the music. The list is endless. Hats off to the whole team to keeping us so engaged as the audience . Winning our hearts and keeping us at the Edge of our seats!! Love the epic duo of Sunny and Firoz. Nana Jee was so authentic in his portrayal of character it was so good for the story line build up. Literally a great show that I had to keep binge watching because I was too impatient to take it slow. DEFINITELY recommend!I hope they release season 2 soon! The saddest moment Was realising the last episode finished.\n",
      "Review 121: Each and every character is loveable in this show. Every character gave his 100% no doubt. This is my first time watching Vijay Sethupathi. He is just incredible. Bhuvan Arora who played Firoz was too good. I loved each and every detail of this show. In the end scene where Shahid Kapoor's face was covered on Red Lights, was a reference to a scene where Megha proved to the CM that RED FLAME means Fake BILL. It was a great detail hats off. Raj & DK took this show on a whole another level. This was a banger. I will definitely recommend this show to my family and friends. I stopped watching series for a while but, This, Farzi, woke me up. Thank you RAJ & DK <3. Eagerly waiting for the season 2. Take love from Bangaldesh.\n",
      "Review 122: I liked the fact that shahid Kapoor played a different role other than what he did in past he tried a new genre in which he explosively did the best role in the series üçø. If I think about my favorite season so money heist would definitely be in the top 3 ranks and it was way similar to that concept i would love to see the season 2 no matter how late you people deliver it but should outstanding like what you did in season one greatly appreciated from my side keep it and just ignore hate rade. A solid 10 ‚≠ê from my side i hope this review reach to you. I would loved to see you reply on this and let me know when the next season is coming.\n",
      "Review 123: The series was very quiet. It is worth watching. I recommend it I hope you make season 2 soonI hope their relationship with that police girl will be good or she will give up... And finally, I request the creators of this ghastly series to start the next season faster I can't wait to see the next season thank you all.I can also say about the script It was written very interestingly and entertainingly... But if the new season started The romantic feeling was lacking at the level of the film... If it is a bit more and the seriousness of the film would be commendable and attractive So we watched the series very quickly with our family.\n",
      "Review 124: Not sure why they want to project poor people will always talk in bad words. Can't even watch for 10 mins, too many bad words used. It is worst than a adult movie. It is definitely not a 15+.Vijay sethupathi wasted his character by accepting the role in this poorly dialogued series. Jeevan once a famous tamil hero damaged his reputation again by providing tamil dupping for Farzi hero character. No middleclass in tamilnadu would like to see this kind of series which has poor dialogs. If you add beep to all bad dialogs in the series you might able to hear only 20% of the entire series. Please ban this series or redialogue the series without any bad words.\n",
      "Review 125: It's like an Indian money hiest with an Indian twists and something unique you have never seen this type of Indian cinema beforeWhat a story what a dialogue's ...And that chor police catch was too awesome, you must watch this , i bet you guys Bing watch it , the pain the emotions the art soo real mannn , i think this is the first web series Shahid sir is doing if am not wrongYou can feel the Kabir sing vibe in the end scene, all the best and I appreciate the great work done by farzi teamAm super duper exited for season two.Congratulations to the Shahid sir and the team of farzi for such an artistic cinematographyI just loved it üòçüòçüòçüòç\n",
      "Review 126: It was thrilling and realistic. From the convincing action and emotions felt by the characters, to the suspense that puts you to the edge. Very addictive to watch. However, as a muslim I had easily noticed that all the \"bad guys\" had Muslim names while the good guys had hindu names. Intentional or not, this should not have been overlooked by the creators. It is truly disappointing when you take interest in something only for it to be biased and offending. I hope my message gets to the creators somehow and they change their ways in future seasons. It should not have happened in the first place.\n",
      "Review 127: One of the best Amazon original series. Keeps you glued to your seat until the end. Wonderful to see Shahid Kapoor in this avatar. Totally unpredictable character change. Even the support cast did a wonderful job. Some of the most hilarious scenes between VijaySetupati and Zakir Husain. This series reminded me of Breaking bad a little. I just Hope the series gets a second season. The character development and attitude of the lead is really amazing. Since this series is in the family man universe, I'm expecting a crossover of characters between the two series in their respective next season's. Waiting for season 2.\n",
      "Review 128: After a long time after Money heist I have seen such a Indian Series critics, dialogues,acting all r upto the mark. Keep waiting for more such a upgdradation in our Indian Cinema. Direction is in very well format having thriller and suspense. Shahid and Vijay Sethupati are a masterpiece of Acting in this nd also Kk Menon is also such a Master Artist. I am Waiting for the Farzi 2.0 eagerly,There are few points which makes the story incomplete and give hint to the viewers that next season may also come soon. My best wishes for the team and also wants to tell the viewers that keep support to such a Masterpiece.\n",
      "Review 129: Series is nice. Everything was perfect. But you may feel, that Indian Version has been super imposed on a phase of Breaking Bad. Though the adaption is very nice, but the story flow for the characters became quite predictable. The gang lord has been changed, product has been changed, artist/chemist has been changed, sidekick has been changed and to some extent the investigator has also changed. Apart of the Indian setting and some thrilling background music, the flow of story felt super imposed which even machine can't check.Everything is perfectly well balanced in Indian context, story flow, superb dialogue delivery and obviously the acting.\n",
      "Review 130: Its been an amazing to watch the acting. I loved Shahid's dialogue delivery, Vijays acting and how he beautifully managed accent and dialects. Fresh story, very good actors and solid punches.Narration is super crisp, connected and well crafted. After a long time, i watched something natural and no filmy/fancy. Director has hand picked people for each roles and delivered with maximum impact. Each character from Chachu to Firoz to Nanu to Kay Kay has done justice to their roles. This is something you cannot miss if you want to watch powerful acting, thrilling story. I m waiting for next season of this show.\n",
      "Review 131: Great Web Series. Worth watching for its deft handling and superb acting especially of Shahid Kappor and Kay Kay Menon. Shahid's underplayed performance is one of the highlights of this very engaging series. Bhuvan Arora too has excelled in all his scenes. The direction, the screenplay, the character build up are all in top gear. There is nothing that makes you feel dissatisfied about anything. In fact, It makes you want to see more of it. I was actually disappointed when the last episode of this first season came to an end. Already waiting for the next season which I hope does an even better job.\n",
      "Review 132: Raj and DK are renowned perfectionists in the entertainment industry, always in complete control of the audience's pulse and their ability to convince. Though their plot may be untested, the duo takes time to settle, perhaps a couple of episodes, as the groundwork for each statistic and analysis is expertly laid out on screen. This duo trusts their casting and their ability to bring out the best in them. Bhuvan Arora and Vijay Sethupathi are the true stars of the show, carrying the screenplay with ease through their natural abilities. Shahid was at his usual best and adapted the character with ease. While \"Last of Us\" struggles to capture attention, \"Farzi\" relies on its plot-based scripting and outstanding cast, with the fireworks only just beginning. Season 2 promises to be a visual and thrilling roller coaster ride, leaving audiences breathless with brilliance.\n",
      "Review 133: Worth of time . Some instances shahid feels to be overacted . Sethupati have worst speaking skills of hindi . I wanted manoj bajpayee as a cameo ,but that didn't happened . Rashi khanna have great character and she also proved her worth. K. K. Menon as a villian is dashing. We also watched himin special ops and you can expect great impact from him . At some instances the series feels to be lengthy .zakir hassan as a minister also acted well,great dialogue delivery,great expressions. The guy who played firoz has done very well and acted better than shahid . I am not against shahid but it is a fact that he overreacted . I hope he will work on it in 2nd season.\n",
      "Review 134: An amazing web series it is the debut of sahid Kapoor is amazing and the story it totally killer... The story was such an interesting that you won't feel bored for a second and the acting and accent of vijay sethupati was just awesome... The way he maintained his accent of malayalam increadibley. The story was bit elongated but story maintained was totally outstanding and the acting by shaheed Kapoor was realistic.... Do over drama, really true efforts to make this web series such realistic and we'll reasearched the theme was totally outstanding..... And trust me it's just a masterpiece creation....\n",
      "Review 135: Fantastic series. Shahid Kapoor is the next Amitabh Bacchan of Hindi entertainment industry. Neil gripping extremely well paced well made series. Rarely made in Hindi. Can't wait for the second season to be available. I don't know the name of all the artists but each one has perfected their roles to the tee. Honestly I sat to see it knowing Sahid Kapoor is there. But I finished all 8 episodes in less than 24 hours. Kudos to the directors and every actor. I rarely watch Prime as am an ardent watcher of Netflix but this one series kept me hooked on till the end. Simply awesome. More power to the team Farzi.\n",
      "Review 136: At the beginning of the series you have a neutral approach but as the story progresses it gets it's depth... The series perfectly manages to give you the thrill and funny aspects and connects you with the characters... The development of the characters can be seen with the progression of the story... Undoubtedly the immense acting skills of Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi,Kay Kay Menon, Bhuvan Arora and many others make the story full of unexpected turns and it gives it perfect touch of Friendship and Bonding which is highly effective to connect with the youth and growing generation... Overall I'll surely recommend all to give it a shot... I'm highly confident you'll not reget... This is worth your time...\n",
      "Review 137: Just watched the show only because of Vijay Sethupathi. Plz give Vijay Sethupathi maximum screen time in next season,he is just awesome. A request to Vijay Sethupathi plz do work more in hindi cinemas,web series. My review is especially for you. You are someone exceptional. Take my lots of love n respect.And if you ever want to show Bangladesh in your movies, web series, please shoot in Bangladesh. The people here like you a lot. Our country may not be as big or as diverse or as beautiful as yours, but it is not too bad either. You will really like it for the purpose of travel or travelling.Love from Bangladesh.\n",
      "Review 138: I love this show! I've always been looking for something similar to Ozark, Better Call Saul, etc. And this show is the closest I've come across in Hindi. Love the dialogue. It's one of my favorite aspects of the show. The witty banter between characters and the playful back and forth, makes the show super entertaining. So entertaining and wholesome lol the characters are so endearing. It's not as dark as Ozark and Breaking Bad but you get the same thrill. The \"cat and mouse\" feel you get in Money Heist. Cops vs Robbers, blurring the lines between good and bad. I highly recommend this show to anyone that is looking for a less dark and faster version of Money Heist or Better Call Saul.\n",
      "Review 139: After watching the trailer, my expectations were too high, and Farzi surpassed them. The story is really good, with fast storytelling, and I love the illustration of each character's personal and family issues besides the main story, which never got me bored. Such a lovely direction by DK and Raj!Now for the acting! Oh my God! This was a special treat for me, as all four of the actors are my favorites: Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi, Kay Kay Menon and Raashi Khanna. All of them were just mind-blowing in their characters. Congratulations to Vijay Sethupathi for his Hindi debut. But I was unexpectedly mesmerized by the acting of Bhuvan Arora; the character called Firoz/Feroz was mind-blowing. He is the star of this series; wow! I also love the role of Saqib Ayub; he has an X factor and led his role quite brilliantly. Seniors like Zakir Hussain and Amol Palekar were excellent as always.\n",
      "Review 140: The Night Manager has all the ingredients for a hit espionage adaptation of a hit novel and an original series. Yet it falls short of the level of the original.The cast is good with some promising talent. Anil Kapoor as a baddie is a fun prospect to watch. He is cut for such roles. Aditya Roy Kapoor has the charm and persona of a spy. Sobhita Dhulipala plays the damsel in distress to the tee. Saswata Chatterjee is equally clever and conniving. Tilotima Shome is a bright spark. She plays a spy boss inimitably.The series has good production value considering the way it is mounted by the makers. The writing by Sridhar Raghavan is intriguing. The storytelling by Sandeep Modi needs more urgency and astuteness I feel. Really wish it soars in the second part. Would be such a waste otherwise.\n",
      "Review 141: I love the story and all of the performances done by the actors. I respect the director and writer of this movie for mentioning the Myanmar crisis. I recently noticed Bollywood movies started using our country's names in their movies. Sometimes in a good way and sometimes in a bad way.It's kind of strange that they used a lot of misinformation about our country in this serious. I personally request them to do some research before giving any information about a country.Last year I watched a movie performance by akshay kumar . In the movie, they talked about our war with Pakistan in a perspective that is totally wrong.\n",
      "Review 142: Despite having Anil Kapoor who shines at a major portion and other versatile actors(not to be mentioned particularly) it's Sridhar raghavan's screenplay and Akshat/Shantanu duo's dialogues that keeps faith on the series....The interesting part is the visual appeal overall the series handled by Benjamin and Ram Verma makes u glued to the idiot Box...Aditya Roy Kapoor portrays as a night manager at a posh hotel does a brilliant job and his body language shows the mannerism and temperament of an ex-lieutenant showing some responsive act in handling tough roles...Fortunately there are no added cheap thrills or twists and turns as the producers honesty in approaching the original series shows their passion towards the art form..Overall the season 2 decides the success of the series as of now season 1 is a promising start.\n",
      "Review 143: I haven't seen the British series yet, so I don't have any point of reference to draw comparisons here, and thus, I wouldn't be doing the honours. Instead, my entire assessment will exclusively be based on the Indian Adaptation's own merits and speaking of that; I must say, this is one compelling series. Not without its frailties, of course, but the way they had sustained the thrill and the element of suspense, it genuinely deserves some words of appreciation from my end.In spy thrillers, we often see the emotional core being used merely as a tool to progress the story, and they in most cases, end up getting sidelined in the course of the action. However, here, this same trope was brilliantly utilised not only as a source of motivation for our central character but also as a catalyst that propagates the well-rounded trajectory of the main plot. Yet again, I would like to applaud the writers, for they had done a brilliant job.\n",
      "Review 144: Such an amazing direction ,storyline and how every character has played its part so beautifully and cast especially aditya roy kapoor being my personal favorite always nail such an underrated actor honestly deserves much much morei am happy there is nothing old bollywood drama which is so predictableIt's different you will be intrigued till last sceneI am waiting for second part eagerlyEvery episode delivers some kind of lessonAnd i love how beautifully they portrayed today's mindset about homosexuality still seen down in our countrySo grab a snack or drink and binge watchingDefinitely a 10/10 for me.\n",
      "Review 145: A very well crafted series of 7 episodes! A spy thriller amusing story with classy sets, costumes, characterisation. Anil Kapoor and Tillotama Shome steal the show. Aditya Roy Kapoor does a decent job as a spy and looks great on screen as a tall, handsome man though intensity lacks in dialogue delivery. But definitely a full on entertainer.

      "Review 146: After a long time I found good entertainment mixed with good role plays by the actors especially Anil Kapoor and Sidharth Roy Kapur. Story is intriguing. They should have released atleast 6 episode in first part. Anil Kapoor puts life in his character. That spy agency lady role is too much dramatic it should have been avoided, it somewhat takes away the genuinity of the show. Now eagerly waiting for the second part. Hope it does not end in a conventional way. Senior actors like Anil Kapoor are a charm to watch, hope they continue in future also. I am also impressed by the acting potential of Sidharth.\n",
      "Review 147: Love the storyline that the series sets up. It gets you up and excited to what will come up ahead. Love the performance of every actor in the movie and also the perfect casting. Casting is done perfectly each actor feels like they are acting in their signature style and gives a feeling the characters are real. The series perfectly acts as a setting for the next part. It creates the perfect suspense for the second part and also creates an excitement in yourself for the second part which will hopefully be even more thrilling, action packed, exciting and even more exciting. I'm honestly just waiting for the second part at this moment.\n",
      "Review 148: It's a must watch, at the end you would feel like you wanted more of it. The story is quite engaging keeps you thrilled till the last moment.Anil Kapoor is awesome as always but Aditya Roy Kapoor takes all attention this time. Fabulous casting, Screenplay is so catchy that you would not want to get up from your couch, awesome job done by the entire cast.The only negative I felt is that it's quite short and the saddest part is that second season is the final season releasing in June 2023. There is no real downside of the show it's an awesome show and truly a binge watch material.Thank you.\n",
      "Review 149: Coming to this series after many disasters from hotstar specials it this is a comeback to see. It is interesting. An Indian show which had top notch production values. Aditya Roy Kapoor one man show. He performed well. This is just a beginning of night manager. Sooner Hollywood hero \"TOM HIDDLESTON\" to join the sets 2024.Eagerly waiting for season 2. After Delhi crime this series was a turn back for Indian TV shows. Just enjoy it. They made a glimpse of S2 at the end of S1. Looks quite promising. It is wortch watch of your time. If you wanna know try this definately you gonna like it.watch it.\n",
      "Review 150: Even though I've seen the original version with Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie, however, that was quite a while ago so I don't remember the details. But I remember it being really really good.The transition to an Indian setting feels like it has worked really well and both leads and the smaller characters are quite good. Anil Kapoor might not be as demonically charming as High Laurie, but handles the part well. And the girl who plays his wife is a stunning woman.It is quite a shame that you have to wait until June to see the conclusion, because the build up has been really good. Can't wait to see the ending.\n",
      "Review 151: The series is well made on trappingThe series is remake of the English version in the same title..all thanks to Sandeep the director and the entire team for making Hindi version with great stars so that viewers like us can watch some good stuffThe making is at par excellence and gives you a feeling as if you are watching some Hollywood series..Both Anil and Aditya looked very young and fresh and acted in more of expressions and less words with supportive females sohbita and tillotama who gave their best i love the storyline and the way part 2 presets i loved it ..............Awesome series ever i have watched.\n",
      "Review 152: I have mixed feelings about this mini series. Anil Kapoor and Saswata Chatterjee did a brilliant job of being the antagonist bunch but Aditya Roy Kapoor and Tillotama Shome had a very meaty part in the beginning in which they really weren't that convincing. Apart from this the setting of the story looked rather forced, I mean how do 3 crooks infiltrate the security cordon of the mafia to rob them in a restaurant, and no one gets their head blown off? That cannot be a thing. Considering the massive success rate of R&AW the portrayal in this series is pretty vague. Bollywood's obsession with hindu terrorist have not died down yet that we can see very clearly! If we can ignore all these negative aspects then it's a fair watch I'd say!\n",
      "Review 153: Action - 7/10 standard of Bollywood in action is raising day by dayStory - 5/10 complete remake of Tom Hiddleston series. Original is better than this to be honestDirection - 4/10 nothing new ,Acting - man Tom Hiddleston is way better in acting, anil kapoor is suited for this kind of plot . Anil kapoor acting is way better than other actors so if you're fan of anil kapoor then this plot is for you. Aditya Kapoor is bit off in acting but played ok I guess .Overall - 4/10Watch only if you haven't already watched the original version then only you can enjoy yourself otherwise take nap it's better.\n",
      "Review 154: All characters are brilliant except the night manager himself. Don't know whether it was because of the class of other actors, but each and every frame of Aditya Kapoor with his co stars shows how bad an actor he is. God knows how the directors did not anticipate this problem before casting this guy. Most of his movements are robotic. There's no diversity nor originality in any of his expressions. Specially when Tillottama is pursuing her to take up the assignment, never did it seem an inner conflict was going on inside. Aditya Kapoor just followed the script. The subtelity and undercurrent did not surface anywhere.All in all Aditya Kapoor is a third rate actor and it was blunderous to cast him along with stalwarts like Anil Kapoor, Sasawata Chatterjee, Tilottama Shome.\n",
      "Review 155: I love the hype that media and social forum creates. This show was so badly done, I call this as a perfect comedy show.Being fair, I did enjoy every bit of the show, as actors did their best in over acting. Oscar said they are now sliding in a new categories for over acting - if not win, these actors could definitely get nominated in this new category.Background music was terrible, it sounded like 1990s hindi tv show, they could put sounds like \"toi\" to bring out that retro feel to it.Director - we should take blessing from him for screwing our brain up so well. He not only ripped off a good tv show, but did an incredible job in screwing it up. He is like Thanos of tv shows. By clicking he probably killed half of the audiences with boredom.\n",
      "Review 156: I love the brand new concept of it... The series night manager is a awesome thriller movie... The actors and the cast was awesome everyone paly a magnificent role on this... Anil kapoor is experienced and Aditya roy kapoor is very charming actor.. Over all it's timing is too good it's screen play engaged you all the time... The Action sequence are good... But it can be more.. Entertainment if it includes more actions... It can be little more lengthy i feel... But the drama is a very brand new concept... Which can win your heart... But story deserve more part of it and and please bring us a new season....\n",
      "Review 157: I've watched the real Night Manager years ago, starring Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie, it felt original. Bollywood is running out of original scripts, songs, content, stars and instead ripping-off, spinning-off everything they can get their hands on to keep the tabs running. SHAME on the crew to even agree to this!I can't watch spin-offs, or ripoffs, its just not real drama. Originality has left Bollywood to an extent where they would settle for any mediocre soap opera, prime time or OTT content that generates revenues and TRP.Try and watch the original series which was shot mostly in Switzerland and Europe and find out for yourself.\n",

      "Review 159: In Bangladesh, marriage laws are based on a combination of religious and civil law. Civil laws dictate that the legal age of consent and minimum age for marriage is 18 for women and 21 for men. How can the writer made up 14 as the age limit? They are just trying to humiliate Bangladesh!The storyline has included many unnecessary things to prolong the duration of the series! The casting is good. Location selection is also good. Performance of the actors are also good.Whenever we watch some remake of an English series, we demand a better version, unfortunately it was not. It was not necessary to prolong each episode for more than 50 mins, and ending the first season is four episodes! Saswata Chatterjee did a bit over acting, which I personally didn't like.\n",
      "Review 160: I cant describe how bad it is. I am really disappointed after watching this. If you are looking for action this is not it. If you are looking for story this is not it. If you are looking for acting this is not it. Wtf was that love story. Come on bollywood why rip off good series and make the worst possible disaster. Most of the story doesn't even make sense. Please do not watch it. I wasted my time expecting it to get better after each episode but its one bad episode over the other. Only Tillatoma Shome did her best in acting. Most of the dialogues are weak. Screenplay was horrible. Waste of time.\n",
      "Review 161: It is after a long time, Netflix has got it all wrong by endorsing Rana Naidu. Because this show does not deserve a platform like Netflix. In fact it does not deserve a platform at all.The Director Duo of Suparn Verma & Karan Anshuman are pretty special. Because they managed to get every good actor on the show to ham away to appalling and embarrassing levels. The Cast per se is not bad, in fact all the actors are quite competent and good but it is the execution which has let all of them down.Be it outrageous and unwarranted sex scenes, filthy language, silliness of dialogues, action and atrocious acting, it is all highly insufferable. I wish this series never saw the light of day. Best avoided if you want to preserve your sanity !!!!\n",
      "Review 162: It is an \"X\" rated series, with all sorts of violations - Dirtiest of the language, highly explicit sexual scenes, unlimited violence & a story which is fit to be filthier than filth. Scenes even you would not like to watch along with your life partner is shown in the series. After watching you feel thorougly disgusted. The Telugu movie industry's degradation is on exhibition here. The filming has stooped down to levels unknown before. A platform like Netflix also has brought down it's stature by patronising this series. My respect & feelings for popular stars Venkatesh & Rana have dived to the lowest ever.\n",
      "Review 163: We don't need indians to create such content that are already being made in the west countiess times .. especially unnecessary sexualisation and forced vulgarities in the name of being diverse ! Completely disappointed that veteran actor venkatesh and rana known for bahubali choose such trash as acceptable to make in India. Even the subtitles are written with vulgarities when the Hindi dialogue didn't have any at places üòÇ.I can understand Hindi cinema is facing a difficult phase but I never expected it to stoop this low! It's so fake when you guys try to be white people ! Don't spoil the veterans who have built up Hindi cinema and it's great legacy.\n",
      "Review 164: I just don't understand what has happened to Indian film makers. Off late they have been making such vulgar series that one just can't watch it with their family and friends. Same with this series as well every episode after every 10 mins there will be a extreme intimate scene in which has no relevance. Story is good but too many diversions which don't intersect anywhere. The whole series could've finished in 5-6 episodes but due to unnecessary sex scene it has taken about 10 episodes . One can give it a skip as there nothing special about this series at all , there are many more wonderful series on OTT platforms which has some meaning to the story and screen play.\n",
      "Review 165: With such talented artists, this could have been so much better.Also, 'A-rated' doesn't mean 'crass'. Look at Game of Thrones, it had its share but the rest was brilliant too. You feel like taking a bath after watching one of these. Also, this language is used by everyone. Usually, there are categories, like in 'Breaking Bad' - Walter White Jr. Will not use foul language, but Jesse would - because of his upbringing, which makes sense.But in this, nope - everyone is in the 'A-rated' series, why not use it?Positives - Venkatesh with his original voice speaking in HindiNegatives - Slow and dis-oriented.\n",
      "Review 166: I don't understand why I watched it for 5 hrs. I was giving it a chance and watched the complete season only to disappoint in the end.

      "Review 167: This is not an adaption of Ray Donavan. It's a clear.cut copied version with very little thought put into adapting for Indian audiences. Also, why harras Telegu actors to speak accented hindi. It's stupid and hilarious. Even the dialogues are clunky and badly translated from the English version. It's sad that reputed south indian actors have to be roped in to glam this b-rated show. Production could have focused more on strengthening the story rather than right wing troping it up. Bad screen play and worse choreography. It's barely held together by Rana's and Venkatesh's charisma. Don't waste your time. Watch the original. You'll not be missing out on anything.\n",
      "Review 168: Devoid of class, full of crass and cuss!Unimpressive story coupled with dreary narrative and lackluster performances from stars. This web series is all about forced use of explicit content and filthy language with no strong premise and subpar execution. Midway through the story, you wish the protagonists die to escape the drag. Might have as well made the role completely Telugu speaking instead of terrible imitation of Hyderabadi Hindi.One of the actors remarks in the series that the audience should feel contented after watching his movie. Wonder if this was thought through by the director while making the series.Save yourself 10 hrs. Of productive time by skipping this series.\n",
      "Review 169: Don't hesitate and give it a watch, I'm assuring you you'll not get bored but wanna aware it's filled with ,18+ contents (slangs, reference, nudity) not that much but still too much for Indian show but it's important for the character.And a great chemistry between Rana & Venkatesh must say and Surveen chawla looked good no doubt apart from that all other supporting characters are also performed well and one more thing it's good to see all the Tv actors, south actor & bollywood actors together in a series and last but not the least I seriously loved the accent of venkatesh.Thanks !!!!! Happy binging.\n",
      "Review 170: Pros : From starting to end, Its gripped storyline along with solid cast and acting. All roles are perfect and done justice with their respective screen time. Full marks to Ranna and Venkat for giving badass performance.Cons : They can deal better with foundation of series where unnecessary put sexuality and minor sexual harassment (which is quite old now). Made benchmark to show higher class in such way which sometimes looks annoying and old fashion.Netflix trying their best for Indian audiences. Its thrilling series which could be good time pass.Rest is fine if you are not watching with family.\n",
      "Review 171: The series starts with vulgar scenes and filthy language. Any fans of Venkatesh Sir, please don't watch this. Nightmares will follow after watching this. Beginning chase scene was shot as though he is going to save a nuclear secret, Neither you feel excited nor laugh at it but cringe and feel bad for Venkatesh Sir's legacy.When series like this get released without sensor, young minds get influenced and think this is the norm.The director and writer might have thought, this is for Netflix so let's make it bold. Instead they made a costly B grade movie with A grade actors.I wish an accomplished actor like Venkatesh Sir could have avoided this. Please don't make poor choices like this Sir.\n",
      "Review 172: Such a worthless copy from Ray Donavan. These casting directors lack the ability to cast these shows properly.Nothing about it is original, they couldn't even give the kids traditional Indian breakfast. Storyline is weak because almost everything is copied, attention to detail is zero, casting is 3rd class, actors look way too young to play the roles they are playing. Lack of creativity in every sphere of the production is astounding and pathetic. Couldn't bare to watch the show for too long. The cast looked so ill-equipped to handle any depth the characters would require to play the roles in any meaningful way.\n",
      "Review 173: I loved Ray Donovan is brilliant TV serial. I have to to admit watching an Indian version I was skeptical, as sometimes the story can change or the acting is not great however I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the show. Some old and current actors so was good to see faces I have not seen in a while.I would rate it 18+ as it's not for the soft heated as it is a little on the dark side with some funny bits. For an Indian series it sure did step out of it's boundaries and touched on a topic that is always overlooked.Overall great acting and hope the story continues as I know there is more to series to show your audience.\n",
      "Review 174: I appreciate the efforts put into the plot development and character arcs in this particular Netflix series, However, I found myself frequently taken out of the viewing experience by the excessive use of profanity.It's ok that certain shows aim to capture a specific demographic or tone, I personally found the constant use of bad language to be distracting and definitelyunnecessary. It detracted from the overall quality of the storytelling and made it difficult for me to fully immerse myself in the world of the show. I would recommend this series to those who are not bothered by such language, but for those who prefer a more subdued approach, it may not be the best choice.\n",
      "Review 175: An adaption of the hit series\" RAY DONAVAN\" is about a family that seeks peace or eternity after doing a sinful act...Rana as a fixer does a splendid job trying to handle the pressure of high society crimes and compromising with the family seems to be a natural performer and his body language does play an easy act...On another hand venkatesh is a show stealer with his natural Hyderabadi dialect makes u strangle with his methodical acting another milestone in his career despite being criticised for his abusive language his presence makes u more love for the series...Surveen Chawlaa shines as a true mother and caring wife...The rest of the characters did a splendid job...Despite sexual scenes and foul language, this series does an impressive weekend entertainment not to be missed.\n",

      "Review 177: Worst narration. There is no story. I recommend Venkatesh to watch this series with his family without forwarding or skip. 1 star also is very high to this. It's a family crime drama and that lead family is a rich but nonsense family they only talk each other with abused words and vulgar signs. This may be a fiction they can call but how come that can be published. I just wanted to know does all the cast or producers and director use the same language with their kids. They may say that demands character but who will be the audience? It is fully adult content nothing else.One request is Mr Venkatesh should watch this with his daughters without skip or forward. Or is this how Venkatesh generally?\n",
      "Review 178: Rana daggubati acting is awesome and the all characters are do their best, and I liked all the series in the Rana Naidu and it could not been boaring! The brothers of rana in the Rana Naidu series are making their characters well, and the venkatesh daggubati the father of Rana Naidu and the coldwar between the Rana and venkatesh daggubati is making us anxious Naina who being the wife of Rana also she is excellent in the character and the Jaffa, OB Mahajan, sreeni, Tara all are done the best acting in the Rana Naidu series! The A rated movie is would be understang the settlements in the industry is clearly we get an idea about it by watching the Rana Naidu series!\n",
      "Review 179: No continuity to follow. New characters in each and every episode that develops a new story without keeping up with thousand other ones that have already been started.A minister going through mental crisis, a father looking to avenge what his son did to him who is also after an actor, a builder who is after the same actor, protagonist's brother believing he has found love then feels betrayed , a rapper living next to the lead actor who has taken in a young lad having a talent for rapping as well and the lead sorting them out, and yes...the personal life of protagonist which is always in a spin. Then the daughter of protagonist who is shown so loud.Overall...people are rating this series so high coz it's in buzz...everyone's talking about it and rating highly so feel a need to do so too.\n",
      "Review 180: This series is another example of the newer offerings from India. It has all the hallmarks of the genre, westernized culture, various types of sexuality, overuse of the \"F\" word by characters speaking in faux style American accents and driving expensive cars. At the same time it also has the usual caste, ethnic and religious conflicts, common to all Indian movies. The dialog is bad and the script poorly written. There is little continuity as a result of poor editing. The story starts to lose its way round about the third episode, and then just becomes a series of loosely linked events, some of which are relevant to the main plot, others not! It's unfortunate that the writers did such a poor job with character development as the lack of that makes for the story becoming just a rather silly mess!\n",
      "Review 181: Overall a nice show to watch.Good: Story is good, acting is also good by most of the actors. Overall you can give it a try but do not watch with family. Rana and Venkatesh is looking good. Ashish Vidyarthi and Sushant Singh has done a good job. Abhishek Banerjee did something different and nice as well. Acting, story, background score and somewhat screenplay is also good.Bad: too much of adult scenes, that are another level as per Indian viewers. Too much of abusive language and that too harsh. Could have been better if edited better or cut down by 1-2 episodes. Fee sex scenes could have been dropped because they seems like not so imported for the story.\n",
      "Review 182: First of all the only reason I would like to watch this bcoz venkatesh. I only dislike this cause of more se*ual scenes and nudes are more than enough. So I would to like to recommend to watch this alone neither than watching with family.After a long long time Venky mama return the films. Taking to the review it was above average feels. If you want to see you can binge its just less than ten hours of content. What i promise you do not bored any of the action part of rana daggupati he did a well done work for this series. That's what I am suprised of . Not a fan of rana but the way he conveyed himself in this wonder.\n",
      "Review 183: 18+ Show. Please do not watch with family.This is a very contextual adaptation of the original and is very well fitted in the Indian context between Mumbai and Hyderabad. Every episode is fast paced and keeps your gripped. The makers were very clear about it being a adult show. Don't understand the noise hating it being adult as if the same audience have not liked other shows with adult content.Ignore everything and give it a watch. It's very commandable of Venky Sir to step out of his comfort zone and try something like this at this age. You have to encourage experimenting or else we will just be left with formula content and stay bored.\n",
      "Review 184: Acting was good...like both the lead actor specially senior rana sir..after such a long time.It was pleasure watching him. His comic timming acc to the script was perfect.But I feel it was over use of profanity and vulgarity... Reset I dnt know...my wife didn't finished the series...for her it was bakwaas..she didn't liked it at all.She was like kehna kya chahte hain...banaya hi kyun hai..The ain't any such series on OTT with that much profanity.. kids are growing now, they have all the access of OTT on tv sets these days... Dnt use that much profanity..Hopeing to see much better content.\n",
      "Review 185: Negativity around Rana Naidu is not true...I just watched began this series casually...it hook me up for 10 hours till the end...beautiful story ...Venky and Rana and all other crew just killed the story with their performances and... story.. screenplay..style of making and visual presentation...dialogues are the best part of this film...thoroughly enjoyedMust watch series for all sections of audience.family bonding...emotional interlink among all of them...crime cinema..industrialists..police..all departments are shown naturally...sex.nudity vulgar language are just terms used in society but it is the true reality of the society..our aspirations.desire struggles ..problems..drugs alcohols..everything in our lives shown in this film with best production values.. nutshell whole team work made this possible.\n",
      "Review 186: Watching this web series felt like i watched it already, then guessed yes!!! \"a family man\", saving his family and making them happy all the time. But yes it was a good experience, and more entertaining. Talking about actors and actresses, they all did best, but Rana Naidu really impressed with his role.!Watching south movies is becoming craze amidst people, as it can be seen that they are coming with mysterious, thrilling contents and presentation of movies and series are spectacular so people are loving.I would recommend should take a time to watch a his web series and have fun on weekends too!! Would love watching how a man is managing between family and work. Fighting to save both work and home!\n",
      "Review 187: Forget Teens- even young adults will feel embarrassed to watch this depiction of women in this filth. 99% of women shown are either committing adultery, drug addicts or you know what. Wow what a thing to be proud of. I am no saint or someone who doesn't appreciate the narration of dark sides of society but this is just to grab eyeballs and pull audiences to this tasteless depiction. Even adult stars will get a complex watching the lewd acts by the female actresses. I am surprised we don't have a citizens movement to ban this. Censor board is a joke. Indian film making has put westerners to shame. I think the only way to earn money for actresses and actors is to perform such scenes on screen.\n",
      "Review 188: The script was written by Luv Ranjan and Rahul Mody, and the performance is equally as brilliant. The ideal actors to perform these characters are Ranbir and Shraddha Kapoor. Not a re-do, but the music and chemistry between Ranbir and Shraddha are excellent. The picture is both original and humorous, making it appealing to a wide audience. You can't help but laugh when you see this photo, and it's perfect for the situation. It's great to see YESS SHRADDHA performing again after a three-year layoff; she and Ranbir are a dynamic duo. Ranbir soon moved to the top of the acting rankings after dating Shraddha Ranbir and providing a stunning performance. Here you may see the trailer for Money Talks. There is not a single fault in this picture.\n",
      "Review 189: How is this series good when it has too much nudity with such high class actors?The level of nudity is at the top level and it was shocking to see it in the first episode itself. This series should have been riven R18+ rating with message of 'extreme nudity'.What's wrong with Indian web series creators? It would haven possible to create a fantastic series without any nudity as star cast is superb. If they simply wanted to sell sex then they could have gone for C grade actors. Netflix does allow series/movies on sex and this series should be classified under those categories.Actors are the only good thing this series has.\n",
      "Review 190: Really loved Watching Rana Naidu.. I'm a Telugu Guy and here we see Venkatesh sir in family entertainers and always we've seen him as a family man.. Never knew He could nail this genre... It's his never seen avatar before.... Although the show has adult content its also wholesome ride of everything you can want... It doesn't involve that mirchi masala fiction fights.. Everything just seems authentic... It has abusive language but it's not like we never heard them before... They just wanted this to be realistic and local... Cast were marvelous.. Rana has delivered one of his career best performances.. He was phenomenal and seemed like that Chad sigma male... And rest of the characters were also fine... I just hope they make 7 seasons of this just like Ray Donovan... I would love to watch all of them.. I wish Netflix renews the show and I would recommend my friends watching it... It's a worth watching show for people who senseful enough watch shows as shows and not messing it with day to day life !! Peace out.\n",
      "Review 191: There is such a no new story, but the main attraction is here actors and actresses, they all have done their job perfectly. Rana Daggubati is so fantastic and charming. But my favorite was Surveen Chawla. She was just superb in this series. I'm thinking that industry is failed to use Surveen Chawla. She is so much pretty one. It's a loss for industry. She is such natural with her skill. And Venkatesh Daggubati sir also plays a superb role in this series. One more attractive subject is HYDRABADI HINDI, it's so much catchy, Venkatesh sir is outstanding with his slowly Hindi voice, Ashis Vidyarthi was fantastic. Everybody has done such a nice job. It's not a masterpiece but once you can swallow it.\n",
      "Review 192: Why is the show called Rana Naidu? Honestly it should have been called Eijaz Sheikh and he should have won the face off. Glorifying characters like Rana Naidu is just not fair.So, someone from CBI who have all the proofs against gets murdered and the one who is involved in cleaning all the dirts of big celebrities gets away. What has happened to good story writing these days.Why is the show called Rana Naidu? Honestly it should have been called Eijaz Sheikh and he should have won the face off.

      "Review 193: Rana and Venkatesh acted really well, story is fresh and keeps you bind. Ashish Vidyarthi was good too, overall its a story of Rana Naidu and his family around him. How Rana managed to kept his family safe even though some past incidents sometimes overshadowed their mental and physical peace. Incidents are sometime predictive but direction is really good. Climax was unexpected but It changed Rana's wife perception that he did it for some reason and it will keep his family safe. I really recommend to watch this series, this is new type of story and all the actors did really well. Good to watch this series.\n",
      "Review 194: I must say. After watching this I am in deeply love with vikramaditya. A man. How Visionary he is . If possible I wanted to meet him and touch his feet. What a director yar. Brilliant . And Aparshakti can perform this way only because of vikrmaditya . Hats off man. What a brilliant story. What a idea sir jee. I would pray that you may get more success and success.please entertain like us. I can feel that how much time and energy you have invested to make this. What a scrrenplay, what a cast . Everything is perfect. Story, cast , writing. I can not wait till 14th April to wait after interval. God bless you sir.\n",
      "Review 195: After long , I watched some Hindi Web Series and I do not regret. Story is good , setup is awesome and acting is superb. I was hooked to this. Some people might try to go in to technicalities of setup etc saying this was not happening in 1950s etc. However I did not find any such big flaw. We cannot be so naive in saying that people were not abusive in that era etc. I have seen in villages that people of our grandfather's age using same abilusive words which today's generation uses üôÇ. Overall a must watch. Thanks Vikramaditya Motwane for taking some risk and making a different kind of series. We need more content like this on TV.\n",
      "Review 196: Mr Motwane take on history of Indian cinema. You can connect characters with dev anand ,Guru dutt, dilip kumar, himanshu rai (owner of bombay talkies)and devika rani web series is well convinced, shot and acted. Amazon prime is becoming hub of good presentation direction of Mr Motwane is of top notch. Aparshakti has improved as an actor. Sidhant, ms gabbi and special mentionMr Chatterjee (he is having a strong presence on screen)must watch for those cinema lovers who are actually a movie buff if you want to connect with this web series kindly brush yourself with indian classics CID ,Pyasa and baazi guru dutt and dev anand were close friends.\n",
      "Review 197: A fascinating watch with an intriguing plot. Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, Jubilee transports you to the nostalgic golden era of Bombay Talkies and its journey of survival. Supported by superb acting and a plot that keeps you hooked. And the mesmerising music is a delight for those who are fans of golden melodies. Every episode moves at a pace that keeps you intrigued with never a dull moment. The 1940s era has been captured so beautifully with captivating foot-tapping music, brilliant camerawork , sets , backdrop and last but not the least is the superb acting by its cast- Sidhant Kumar and Apaarshakti Khurana have done a brilliant job . Ram Kapoor, Prasenjit have also done a good job. Eagerly waiting for S2.\n",
      "Review 198: Jubilee is a web series that takes viewers back in time to the golden era of Bollywood in 1947. With a talented and well-dressed star cast, this series captures the essence of the era perfectly.The production value of the series is evident from the stunning set designs and the rich attention to detail in every scene. The music is also top-notch, transporting viewers back in time with its classic sound.What truly sets Jubilee apart, however, is the incredible acting from the star-studded cast. Every member of the cast brings their A-game, immersing viewers in their characters and making them feel as though they are truly living in the 1940s.\n",
      "Review 199: Story of a great Film studio & characters linked to them. A powerful studio owner & his team wields power on Box office of 40s & 50s, iterlaced with India Pakistan partition , a nautch girl trying her luck in mumbai film industry ,a refugee writer & actor struggling to make foothold in then film industry & faithful servant of Studio owner struggles to become a super star, all these. Appears surreal & out of untold stories creating a confusion between real happening & fiction, Mr Motwane has hit the bulls eye in creating a magnum opus, almost looks like biopic & not to Forget Greta garbo of Indian films.\n",
      "Review 200: Soviets, Americans, Information & Broadcasting ministry .... too many conspiracies and conspiracy theories, add a weak and convoluted script into the mix, and the result is a good-looking concoction of confusion. Is it a period piece about cinema or a love story or thriller? What is it?The set design and art direction are good and give a feel of the era. The costumes of male characters are also good, but the costumes of the female characters seemed too modern most of the time-same issue with the dialogue.It started with a bang but nose-dived and crashed by the 8th episode, and the last two episodes test your patience. For a slight relief - Amit Trivedi's music is outstanding and sounds like the Bollywood music of the 1950s.\n",
      "Review 201: I'm socked to see it's detailing level!. It's songs just blow my mind ..... I never forget it's songs...all actors are incredible... specially..my favourite Shidhant and Prosenjit sir..... actually I don't know how review write...but try frist time..at first I'm not happy to see it's 1-3 episode...but when I came 5th episode it's incredible....and ending, broken!!.The main positive things about this series is it's tell about behind the scenes of cinema of those time... it's like knowing history with enjoyment...I'm so happy to see it ..if you love cinema and wanted to know what happened in those time ,\"off the screen\" then you must watch it.\n",
      "Review 202: \"It takes humongous effort and sheer willpower to pull off something like Jubilee, and kudos to Amazon Prime for supporting such an ambitious show to finally get the recognition it deserves. The only underwhelming aspect is that we don't get to see Vikram Aditya Motwani's work more often. I hope that changes after Jubilee. Moreover, I think everything was on point, especially the acting. Trust me, you don't get to see such character-driven roles often; it is literally a blessing! In the end, even though we are broken and fate has been nothing but cruel one thing remains and that is the love for art.\"\n",
      "Review 203: This series is clearly made for an Indian target audience. It has little in the way of global appeal. The acting is very mediocre and very Bollywood, and the usual tales of partition are rehashed again. The set design is good but the character dancing the \"Boogie Woogie\" is straight out of a comic book, not a history book! It's very fanciful with stilted dialog, and the usual subtitling errors. Watch it in Hindi as if one watches the dubbed version in English, the subtitles in English do not match the dialog! It's a major fail and very distracting. If you like to watch a fantasy production that is very predictable, then this will work for you!\n",
      "Review 204: Period dramas first of all need to get one thing right, the \"feel of the era\" in make up, costume, dialogues, sets. The attention for details makes it feel real or fake depending on which side the movie or series leans toward. This one fails miserbaly on all these fronts of dialogues, costumes, make ups. Other than digitally created sets, there are too many modern day elements for u to really get engaged. Just one of many examples, Ram Kapoor's character's expletive laden dialogues are equivalent of mirzapur characters'. 1947 feels like 2020 UP or Mumbai underbelly. Couldnt go beyond first episode as could't get engaged at all.\n",
      "Review 205: Words are difficult to find to describe this master piece from Vikramaditya Motwane. Amazing story, direction, sets, costumes and above all acting by mostly new faces. People who have watched and loved movies from fifties or sixties will surely fall in love with it. Did not know about politics/influence of USSR on Hindi cinema of that time, probably too big to be true. It will be wrong to single out one person for acting. Kudos to director Motwane and writer Atul Sabharwal and the whole supporting crew for bringing such a beautiful story and the Hindi cinema of late fourties'/fifties alive. Loved it...\n",
      "Review 206: Absolutely loved the show. Well directed and felt as if you are in the 1950s.Actors to watch - Sidhant Gupta playing Jay Khanna, Wamiqa Gabbi playing Nilorfer and Aparshakti Khurana playing Madan Kumar. Sidhant Gupta was a total package. A visual treat along with flawless acting. His passion, his sincerity is visible in his character. Wamiqa Gabbi played a strong headed woman who knows what she wants in life and is unapologetic about it. Even if you would like to not like the character, you will ultimately start appreciating her strong headedness and her guts to live life and aspire what she wants.\n",
      "Review 207: This is pure magic, simply superb! Words will fall short to praise this. Every character is portrayed with immense intensity in depth. This series is pool of emotions - there is greed, lust, revenge, love, tragedy. The last 10 mins summarising was just captivating. The black and white era story keeps one completely captivated. Haven't seen anything like this before. Hats off to Vikramaditya Motwane! May season 2 come soon. My ratings 9/10!This is pure magic, simply superb! Words will fall short to praise this.

      "Review 208: When I started watching , didn't expect the series to be so good. The scenes still run in my mind days after watching it. The casting was brilliant. The established actors are wonderful but Sidhant And Wamiqa steal your heart. Their scenes together just light up the screen .The sets and costumes are very well designed. The moment the scene switches to B&W, it instantly transports you to the Doordarshan days of movies. The songs by Amit Trivedi / kaisar Munir helps in recreating that era. Instead of making copies of oldies, they have created something totally new that goes with that era. My fav is wo tere mere ishq ..What a series.. it's a must watch !\n",
      "Review 209: Jubilee is a series about cinema and movies when it was in its initial stages. The rise of cinema, the rise of superstars, stars, the ccompettion then, the inner politics, gosips and all the inner story of the circles of Indian cinema in a fictitious way they have presented the story. Nice acting by the cast and nice message they have tried to provide through the story. I loved particularly the acting of Aparshakti Khurana and Aditi Rao Hydari also Pransenjit Chatterjee. I had a nice expereince watchng thiss series. This series episodes duration was 1 hour each and none of the episodes were oring. Nice storytelling and nicce interesting way they have presented the story. I recommend you to watch the series. I rate Jubilee 7 stars out of 10. Few stars I have removed because this series is not too much awesome, not less awsome. Thiss sries is medium, I wwould say and accordingly I have rated this series 7 stars out of 10. This series could have been more good. I liked the songs and music and the retro way they have tried to present this story.\n",
      "Review 210: I really like the show but I felt the cast was opposite for the actor whom I thought was ugly and cheated his way through and the other guy refugee who was so hot and good looking. I'm pretty sure a lot feel the same. Not sure if this was intentional to show how ugly people make their way through cheat and deceit. In a way also makes you laugh why Bollywood people would think the ugly is handsome(like the Opposite Day game). Now Hollywood does that on steroids with their new requirements for cast and bla bla.... I guess this the reason why entertainment industry is losing money everywhere since they've just become propagandists.\n",
      "Review 211: Who all giving 10* to this sad saga? My God!! It's sooo slow and boring, couldn't even finish 3 episodes completely without fast forwarding it. It's too slow, sad, dull and dead. Why put people to sleep in the name of art! Art can be entertaining too. I was really interested in watching a good period drama and woke up early to watch it, but man why give such boring nonsense. Just pompous no matter at all. Not watching the rest of the episodes. Aparshakti is good but not very convincing, Siddhant is gonna be a huge star for sure, he was the only good thing also Wamiqa, she was brilliant too. Let's not even talk about Aditi, she has just one tone expression, can't bear her anymore, in pictures or shows! I'm so disappointed in this show but can't expect much from someone who has delivered duds in the past. Please skip it and go out with your friends and family. I'm better off watching a cat play with its a tail for hours, atleast that's some entertainment, also pure art.\n",
      "Review 212: Brilliantly captures the chaos, madness, compromises that is ideating, storytelling, producing, marketing, releasing and the audience's love of them!How things work in background and the interests / personal relationships/ rivalries /politics of the day and the ugly side of it!Fabulous production and period details, consumes, sets with many a scenes (albeit cliche) that takes one in the nostalgic golden era of the old Hindi movies. Excellent casting and controlled performances by all the cast. All in all a good watch.A fantastic melting pot of all the method in madness that is Bollywood. Take a bow - Cast and crew!\n",
      "Review 213: Such a wonderful script and outstanding performance. After a long time such a masterpiece screenplay before us. A must watch movie. Impressive work donne by Aparshakti Khurana. This masterpiece makes you crazy. I am going to wait eagerly for next series of this. Each and everyone do the justice with their performance. I had started watching not by just a huge expectations but after watching it I feel awesome. The memory of each scenes makes you pleasure after ending the session.A great and iconic direction had made it masterpiece.Once again I must say this is a movie which made in decades. Everybody must watch and enjoy it.\n",
      "Review 214: A great series. Probably my favourite after Breaking Bad! The Pilot episode is like a film itself. Has to be the best pilot in any language after Breaking Bad's. Also the best episode of the entire series. Totally loved it. It's not a film within a series, Jubilee is the Cinema here. And outstanding performances from each cast member, but Aparkshakti Khurana owns this one, what an act he has put on here, truly the director's actor. Jay Khanna is everyone who wants to make films today, fully emotionally connected with his characterisation. Written perfectly with beautiful cinematography, shines in every other department - production design, costume, makeup, editing. So many parallels to old Hindi films like 'Kagaz Ke Phool', 'Pyasa', 'Awara', and probably the best homage to the iconic movie 'Shree 420'. Overall I loved it so much that I would put this series at top, above Scared Games and all other shows in India. A must watch if you're a cinephile, love old Hindi films and interested in filmmaking...\n",
      "Review 215: After many years i am fully impressed with all departments of this series . Story, music , acting ,light sound , fight ,dress , make-up,hair style,art , camera ,direction and all the department had done a research to create this Aura of Jublee . Kuddus to all departments even all involved in pre and post departments . Special mension to casting department -Perfect Job .I think this series can be treated as documentation of Bollywood 40s -50s .Before 1947 and after Independnce of India till today no one can prove but there were propononda movies sponsered by unknown sources to glorify mugals .\n",
      "Review 216: If your teenage years has a soft corner for a film called Udaan, here is Motwane with another masterpiece albeit this one is on a much grander scheme, a glass of old alcohol that you sip slowly over the hours and marvel at the subtle flavours but high notes! Jubilee is a masterpiece, the jarring soundtrack riles you up and the characters are so well written, selfish, every single one of them, flawed but everyone has some good in them. Madan Kumar BC is a terrific anecdote added in every episode and he shines through, even if Jay is given more hero like characteristics, it is Madan and Roy babu who has the best dialogues. I have saved the '5 rupay pehle Maine aap par lagaye the' dialogue forever in my memories due to the sheer brilliance of it. It is an ode to the Cinema we thrive to experience and is worth every star it receives.\n",
      "Review 217: Headline says all. The best and the finest that has been made in India for OTT.Every positive reviews already have praised all the departments except one. Background score.All are in praise of the songs by Amit Trivedi. Do one thing- skip over the songs, you will still enjoy the series but mute the background score, the intensity of the scenes and the tension building will be lost by 50%. Bravo Alokananda Dasgupta!Advice from audience: please drop all the Khans Kumars Devgans Roshans. Take these fresh faces and more new faces please. - if you want to resurrect the Bollywood.Climax: Prime is surpassing Methflix.\n",
      "Review 218: The world that motwayne creates is truly mesmerising. With comparatively lesses budget than any hollywood production he makes up with his brilliance what is lacking in cgi. Loved the acting by all the characters. The series being set in mid 20th century also emulates many of filming styles of that time. Set design is amazing which creates an atmosphere that doesn't take you out of the setting. All the different shades of bright orange lights adds to the aesthetic. Music by amit trivedi is too good especially the ending song. Siddhanth gupta's character portrayal may seem over the top some times but he is clearly the star of this show. You can't escape his charm.\n",
      "Review 219: The series is just mesmerizing the way every sequence is shot and top it up with excellent music from Amit Trivedi. Every scene is a piece of art and the artists excel in every scene. Some of the scenes that leave deep impact are the scenes from opening episode showing the partition unrest, another unforgettable scene is the scene of rain where Jay expresses his love and not to forget the the teary heartbreak in the last episode. The chemistry, the emotions, the joy, the sorrow, the tears feel so real. Characters of Jay and Niloufer are the highlights while everyone else has also done a superb job. The end song in the last episode gives you the nostalgia of \"Ye Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaye Toh Kya Hai\". Excellent watch, excellent performance from the director and the whole cast!\n",
      "Review 220: Everything about this series is amazing. Cast, Characters, Dialogues, Music, Locations, Sets, Songs.... everything. It holds your attention and interest throughout. Gives you hopefully an honest glimpse of yesteryear's Indian cinema.It also nicely weaves in the times of that era. How the political and economic eras were influencing each other.All artists have done their proper homework. And no shortcuts have been taken. Credit goes to the director to really put his heart in this timeless masterpiece.If you are from that era it will take you back and if you are from the current crop, the aura and character of that era will mesmerise you. A must must must watch.\n",

Masterclass Acting by @aditiraohydari @prasenjitchatterjee @RamKapoor #jaykhanna #wamiqagabbi.... with this you have a series that is not to be missed. First time in webseries history this much songs have been kept and every single song have it's own beauty and deepness. Frankly I've never wrote any review on this platform but this series has made me to write.. And in last Aditi madam is a gem of a artist, wish one day I would meet her...

      "Review 222: It is one of THE BEST AMAZON ORIGINALS I have watched in the recent times. Amazing storyline and great performance by all the characters.First two to three episodes are spent on character building and building the story, after that you will root for each and every character and will be excited to see what will become of your favorite character. I was mesmerized to get lost in the Talkies world of India during 1950's and how movies were used to empower people.Best performance by Aparshakti Khurana, Aditi Rao Hydari, Sidhant Gupta and Wamiqa Gabbi. Even though the role of Swetha Basu Prasad was small but her presence and acting skills were stunning.\n",
      "Review 223: Stunning performances by all the lead actors. Direction department has done a stunning job. Art direction is at top notch. They have done a thorough research and designed the sets, i am surprised by their work on every minute detail. They must have worked very hard on that part. Though the narration is a bit slow, i hope this will be good in season 2 and 3. I have watched the whole series in 2 days. All the actors have done thier part. Each character has its own charisma, each character is a hero, villan with positive and negative shades. I loved the casting of each character. Not the least i cannot forget niloufer‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§. Waiting eagerly for season 2. All the best for the team.\n",
      "Review 224: Very bad web series and its very slow waste of time and boring. Ending is worst part of this web series am not satisfied with story.Characters are done brilliant job but story is not worthy.Aparshakti Khurana(Binod das) and Aditi Roy(Sumitra) both acting was looks very real and suitable to their characters. But as i told you this web series is very slow you can't watch continuous its feel very bad.Most important ending could be better eventually everything ended with sadness and all characters loose none of them wins this battle you can't support any characters as hero. All characters have done some negative things .\n",
      "Review 225: This is my first ever review on IMDB and I had to chose this title for me review but this is the perfect tagline for JubileeOh man how I loved this series. Vikramaditya Motwane you are simply put a genius. You and Anurag Kashyap are the best things that happened to Bollywood since Farhan Akhtar.What a great series Jubilee is. Beautiful portrayal of the 1949-50's Bombay. The agony of love, jealousy, success, hate and in the end self destruction. From Dialogues to Screenplay to Editing to the Sets to Costume Designing to Direction to Acting everything is just top notch and perfect. Attention to detail is perfect. I don't think you can come up with a better end product.P.s. I would have also fallen in love with the character of Nelofar.\n",
      "Review 226: I am sure that overall story would have been inspired by some real events in Bollywood but to bring it together the way Vikramaditya Motwane has achieved is simply awesome. A compelling story, slick direction, fabulous cast and their prefect acting, brilliant photography and sets etc. And to top it all some awesome music from Amit Trivedi which has been sung so well by Sunidhi, Vaishali, Irfan etc. The music is set to sound like that in 40s and 50s, songs are well written and are enjoyable. Siddhant Gupta, Aparshakti, Wamiqa, Prosenjit and Aditi Rao Hydari bring life to their characters whilst other cast members play their roles to perfection. We almost binge watched it and the series stays on you mind for quite a while after that. We now enjoy listening to songs.\n",
      "Review 227: I know there are some flaws in the story but you have to accept that this kind of series is never made in Indian shows. Try to watch this rather then nonsense tv shows! Bollywood need this right now!\n",
      "Review 228: Desperately waiting for the season two. This first season raised my expectation to watch more and more good content.\n",
      "Review 229: The excessive use of terms like artificial intelligence, software, and hacking messed up the storyline. Although it's still watchable, the attention to detail is completely missing. There's a part in Asur 2 that feels out of place, where victims are given remotes with red and blue buttons to choose from, which is hard to believe and doesn't connect well with the rest of the show. The characters don't develop much, and the show lacks the charm of mythological tales. Another issue is that sometimes things don't make sense, like when the stock market crashes, the government and the investigative team's reaction seems dull and too easy. The series becomes depressing with too much focus on technology talk and spending too much time in front of computer screens. While the misuse of technology is explained well, I missed the excitement of watching DJ, Nikhil, and others solving mysteries and facing challenges themselves.\n",
      "Review 230: Logic is replaced with intuition. Intuition cannot be explained, and so as the murders get solved with a sudden ease, you lose interest. There is a believability to it that makes for engaging viewing. Here, you sort of give up on trying to connect the dots, or even understand more deeply how the murders were concocted. (Intuition in thrillers is often a result of lazy writing.)Then, there is the convenient use of Indian mythology that has space for both gore and lore. Using mythology to make something sound sexier, edgier almost, is similar if not the same as using Urdu to make damp squib moments sound romantic. (Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, Kalank) It is quite easy to spot the pointlessness of the exchange. Not going to talk on potholes and mistakes as they are explained aptly in above reviews but one thing for sure, brevity is not one of Asur's priorities.\n",
      "Review 231: I do not really understand why people gave 9.2 stars. Too confusing storyline, and way too much dramatic.\n",
      "Review 232: Just finished Asur best web series in Hindi best mix of science and Hindu methodology. Eagerly waiting for part 2 superbly done man love it\n",
      "Review 233: Arshad Warsi you nailed it. It's awesome story and very well directed. Hats off to all the characters, everyone played their part really well.\n",
      "Review 234: After seeing quite a few positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. I was disappointed. I couldn't even finish of the entire series. Acting was way over the top. I mean, for instance, when autopsy is done, it's a common sense to wear a mask. But bollywood is so obsessed with the face, that they forgot to add this simple thing. Story was very filmsy and not at all realistic. This is acceptable in bollywood movies, but tv series gives you a lot of scope to expand. I gave it 1 rating because I like watching Anupriya goenka on screen.\n",
      "Review 235: A very very average stuff, its shot like some tv commercial, and the Music is very repetitive and below average, and its irritatingly annoying and monotonous, repeating the same string notes / music.. Low grade.And above all, the murder scene video which was seized while investigation was obviously evident that it was shot from different angles with professional cameras! How can the seized murder video be like zoomed and panned with the murderer?? It was shown like somebody is shooting the video with red cam...! Not at all convincing direction, and its like making fool out of public... Overall its very hyped and crappy...\n",
      "Review 236: Weakest screenplay in great packaging..even the actors look exactly same after and before 10 years with similar attire and look (with same glass and beard )... Backwass..\n",
      "Review 237: Acting was very good, but the plot lacked too much. Right in the very 2nd episode it was easy to figure out who is who. One very bad thing about this series is that characters which were portrayed as being super smart in the first few episodes, all of a sudden they were made to look like idiots without getting the grasp of the situation. As a result it becomes quite obvious that the script dances here and there just to create situations anyhow.\n",
      "Review 238: Didn't like it .....dragged....poor acting...............\n",
      "Review 239: Asur is going to win all awards this year. Best acting, brilliant direction and with super story line it is the 10/10 rated web series.\n",
      "Review 240: The season 1 of ASUR had so much of promise and it dealt with the fields of mythology and forensic science, which have not been explored much previously. The first few episodes were very well-executed and at times, I believe, the makers were successful in injecting fear and thrills into the minds of the viewers. However, as the episodes went by, irrational storyline, astonishing plot holes and poor performances started to muster. At the end of the day, season 1 turned out to be very mediocre and highly overrated.\n",
      "Review 241: Asur is not only top rated series but it is actually deserve it. No loose point i found in this everything is top\n",
      "Review 242: Do not fall for the hype like most of us did. The only thing good about this show is the hype that was created.There are a lot of illogical things in the show which constitutes for really bad story telling. Not sure why Nikhil's character looks like a drunk Devdas. Nusrat looks depressed all the time. It seems so easy for the killer to do everything and the hacking part is ridiculous.If you have watched Sacred games then don't attempt to watch this better yet just watch CID.\n",
      "Review 243: The best web series till date. A bit dark though but don't miss this Masterpiece\n",
      "Review 244: The use of mythology , the background score , the script and cinematography are the only good things about this show. Was very much disappointed by Arshad's lack of expression and lack of urgency as a detective. More so was surprised to see a forensic officer leading a team of detectives. Barun Sobti and Sharib Hashmi did a decent job. Others were bad. You could easily find plethora of loopholes and and stating from episode 5 there is a downfall in quality. The last episode was horrific.Such strong scripts need better directors and actors else everything goes to vain.\n",
      "Review 245: Asur brilliant! Gaurav Arora is the hottest thing I've seen in a long time!\n",
      "Review 246: There are so many loopholes in the execution of the story, I was just tortured to watch it. The backdrop of the series is an interesting one. However, the execution went totally wrong. I am surprised and shocked as to how so many people are giving it 10 out of 10.\n",
      "Review 247: Well for me, it was way better than Sacred games. I watched this series only because of Arshad Warsi. A very underrated actor, who deserves much more appreciation.Script was tight, it was a worthy binge watching for me. Though I felt the series was slow many times, still very much watchable.\n",
      "Review 248: This web series came with lots of promise but what I saw is script full of loop holes and the writer may be tangled in his own idea on how to untie the climax.\n",
      "Review 249: Many of the scenes in the movie were awesome where Arshad was showing his intense character.even the drawings of the asur looked realistic.The murderers also gave a real pictureThe overall cinematography was quite appealing\n",
      "Review 250: The excessive use of terms like artificial intelligence, software, and hacking messed up the storyline.

      "Review 251: Too many plot holes.The initial setup was great, but the writers screwed it up big time.CBI is a joke. They start with a small assumption, then they fully convince themselves that it is the only possible way things can go. Then everyone fully commits to it.What.the.???\n",
      "Review 252: It was predictable and the writing was choppy. Didn't liked it that much\n",
      "Review 253: A lot of things just doesn't make sense at all in this tv show. How things are done are always will be questionable. Just not worth watching.I think the ratings are falsely created.\n",
      "Review 254: Great mixture of mythology & science in to a episode bowl. Amazing watch.\n",
      "Review 255: If this show had a budget like Hollywood, this could have been one of the best thriller series of all time. The plot is unbelievably good! It has the ability to force you to binge watch. The actors have done a great job, the director in his budget did more than what he could have i guess. What i feel is that we are so used to of watching Hollywood and Netflix that we expect the same kind of screenplay which was not upto the mark, not the entire thing but the transition of scenes, the finer details like the coding part. But more or less it was worth the wait for 3 long years. Hat's off to the writing team, you guys have done something which will be appreciated not today, not tomorrow, somewhere in future.\n",
      "Review 256: I don't know what the hype is about. Mindboggling mediocracy here. Absolute mockery of CBI and intelligence agencies globally. Writers lost the plot after episode 1. complete waste of time\n",
      "Review 257: Lot of loopholes on entire storyline, random charactors appear and undie importance is given to main characters which does not go as per story line..lot of other series available on OTT which are far better in execution\n",
      "Review 258: Story - learn to make a story with logic, amazing glitchesNO detailingAbrupt ending - honestly, I do not trust on these flying series to get any secon seasons. So, whoever watched this, are being befooled\n",
      "Review 259: It is simply disastrous, as you can expect from an Indian series. Poor direction, story, acting was just ok. There is nothing in this series which makes it anywhere comparable to any international standard. Indian cinema is way behind than international cinema. If you are a fan of Nolan, Scrocese, True detective etc..then you wont be able to watch it completely. Don't waste your time.\n",
      "Review 260: It's a dark thriller exploring forensic science and ancient Indian Mythology. It's kind of haunting and very well scripted.Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti keep you glued to the screen.\n",
      "Review 261: Had nothing to watch , so i started this with no expectations. It proved to be one of the best Hindi web series.Its really engaging and keeps you on your seat till the last episode. I would recommend this to all who loves to watch a psychological thrillers.\n",
      "Review 262: The series could be way better with the concept they have. No thrill at all. After watching the series, CBI officers might feel ashamed on them selves. CBI aka Central Bureau of Investigation, right? Where's the investigation? Series can't justify the role of CBI officers at all. Even the crime patrol episodes are more thrilling and more realistic then this series with the proper justification of the characters. Plot with too many holes, Too many errors. A normal person can find too many mistakes and why can't CBI?\n",
      "Review 263: Damn good till 7th episode. Then comes 8th episode, and you try to understand if this is directed by same person who did other 7 !! Too many gaps, idiotic things, and difficult to believe actions. Extremely intelligent folks of CBI fail to do basic things in last episode.Highly disappointed!\n",
      "Review 264: The story was weak with a bad ending. Also too many inconsistencies and plot holes.\n",
      "Review 265: So many flaws in direction. Good plot wasted with poor direction and screenplay.In order to compete with Netflix and to make bizzare drama, some producers are creating crap. Sorry But this is below par. Timeline and sequence of events of people from one place to another. Heor's wife suddenly joins the investigation, If you like \"Final Call\" go ahead, If you hated it just skip this one and watch better things.\n",
      "Review 266: To watch this rubbish I bought Voot select, I want a full refund and compensation so I can get myself checked by a doctor, I haven't stopped pukking since I watch this.Horrible, no acting, no story, lot of loop holes, lot of things copied from here and there.The cast is the worst, they are not even actors.How all peverts are giving this trash 8 and above stars, I will give -1 star not even zero.\n",
      "Review 267: Interesting and gripping in intial episodes than just plain Indian dysfunctional crime drama.....\n",
      "Review 268: I'm in Asur hangover. The opening & ending background music is haunting. It's stuck in my head. Honestly, it's one of the best shows I've seen thus far. Can't stop raving about the writing, direction and acting.\n",
      "Review 269: Just binged watched Asur in a day. This is the first time I have ever seen a Web series in a single day. Finally an intelligent show that is at par with western series. Thanks for bringing such an outstanding series.\n",
      "Review 270: I enjoyed every episode except last episode. It didn't give me full clarity about murder. I don't understand why Nikhil let 3 people free from gas chamber instead of his daughter but before he helped 3 people to kill. Who does that in reality? In 6000 people if you guess 3/4 people that understandble but if you choose1 main person, that's unbelievable. There are many more. However its very engaging never loose pace. Full of thrilling and nice concepts. Acted so well everyone. I love to see Nusrat more, she's damn hot. Very nice. Asur would be my 4th all time favourite Indian web series.1st always 'Delhi Crime'2: Pitchers3. Permanent Roommate4: Asur5: Sacred Games (1st season)6: Mirzapur7: Yea meri Family\n",
      "Review 271: Over hyped show, except for first episode the show loses track and story becomes less convincing. Many of characters are not convincing as CBI officers and most of the time protagonist are shown as know all. Antagonist is not suited for the character. Childhood role of Shubh is played very well, the grown up shubh looks less menacing.Concept is good, but could have been implemented better.\n",
      "Review 272: It's all about Autopsy and murder sequence. If you have seen Gray anatomy then this series is desi version of GA. Dialogue deliveries are pathetic. Only Arshad Warsi is strong character but his role is very weak.If you don't have anything to watch them skip initial 40 minutes of all episodes and watch only last 4-5 minutes of episodes.\n",
      "Review 273: The series has a great premise, Indian mythology mixed with a criminal thriller. However, the script and the acting is so lousy that the whole series becomes a massive letdown. Barun Sobti has to have rolled in tons of money into the shows, cos he is just horrible in this series. But, can't fault him much cos the writing is pathetic. No logic, rationale, lots and lots of plotholes. After watching this my appreciation of Sacred Games goes several notches higher. They managed to have a perfect blend between spirituality, crime, intentions, and reality. This is just a lacklustre attempt into this genre.\n",
      "Review 274: Most of the things which are being shown are not reliastic even remotely practical.Not even a good storyline, all the govt agency was not able to win even once in all the 8 episode.Villas knows everything before hand always utter non sense. Was expecting better post first season but they have stretched the season 2 too much unnecessary.Story line could have been made more sense full. Unnecessary jargons throughout the show.Most idiotic is just using the latest terminology AI, blockchain, crypot currency and AI and I think director do not have any idea how AI works and is built. Just random usuage.\n",
      "Review 275: A series comprising of failed attempts to recreate some of the best scenes from various hollywood flicks.The execution is very bad after couple of episodes.Unrealistic, no good, no brainer & good for nothing content. The Sanskari series was supposed to invoke the \"dark Knight\" kind of inspiration but wannabe Nolen failed miserably. Don't recommend and the director should be banned from making any more garbage.\n",
      "Review 276: It is complete waste of time...there are endless errors and suspense without any logic that feels irritating especially after episode 6...\n",
      "Review 277: I have no idea why this series has been rated 9. I have only watched the first episode and cannot continue further due to the high number of flaws in this one.The protagonist is a forensic officer (Arshad Warsi) who is keen on solving the case than doing his job of assessing a dead body. Is he getting paid more than needed that he and his entire team is behind solving a murder mystery in the first place. ?The repeated touching of the self body parts by the forensic technicians in between the autopsy just in the first episode was another uncontrollable experience. These are only few of the epic flaws which were in the series. Do not want to continue blaming the creators here as I do not want to give any spoilers.The script might he really good but when u got creators like these any script should be going to the trash.\n",
      "Review 278: Won't be watching the second season. Cimex was predicted and very bad.\n",
      "Review 279: Never ever have I come across such intolerable and baseless series... Someone please refund me for my time spent and payment made to the OTT platform\n",
      "Review 280: Waste TV Show who does not bother about logical audience . They dont feel important to explain how this guys murdered that Businessmen. Overall it sucks.. dont waste your time.. rather watch Criminal Justice on hotstar.\n",
      "Review 281: Before watching this web series I had an opinion that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix, and Breathe season 1 on Amazon are best web series made in India . But now my opinion is TOTALLY CHANGED, It's Voot select ASUR which is the best web series made till date in India. This is \"The Best \". It is realistic, it is gritty and it is Chilling. You will be glued to your seats. There are no big promotions of Voot select or this Web series. But trust me it is one of the Gems , a pure Gold, in Indian Television and Web Series culture. I have never written such a praise for any other Movie or Web series. It is good to see that standard of of Indian Cinema and Television is rising. We always had good actors in our Industry butnow Directors are working on plot also. Standard of our stories is also rising.Finally, just one word brilliant.....\n",
      "Review 282: Good direction,script,acting and an overall class act. Waiting for sequel and hats off to the idea behind the script and it's execution. Worth your time\n",
      "Review 283: Very poor acting from almost everyone. plain faced arshad warshi.. Highly confusing plot and people find clue almost from nowhere.. Made a complete mockery of CBI. The overall plot seemed great for the first few episodes and then it becomes plain cat and mouse game where they are finding clues from god knows where...\n",
      "Review 284: As if showing some brutal murder scenes and creepy dead body can make a series so much thrilling. Illogic and unrealistic serial killing with extreme level poor performances expect Arshad Warsi as well as poorly predictable story. The performances of the characters are the weakest point and mental torturing.\n",
      "Review 285: Ending is just \"bekaar\"...... Don't watch.... Ending is not satisfactory.....time waste...\n",
      "Review 286: At last i deside to review this, Asur is the mindblowing plot with poor acting and story way. There is a boy who has mastermind to kil anyone he want but the weak point is there is no one in india who can compete him. So as usual all attemp to save next victim result as a failer which is really odd. A better way to show this plot would be intelligent enough to save one time and fail another time, it will be much better. I dont know why bollywood interest to show own peopler as loser or failer. I hope real CBI is more intelligent than they have shown...\n",
      "Review 287: Not worth the hype. Poorly written n executed. It could have been better.\n",
      "Review 288: Such an unrealistic dull series...a total yaaawnfest!!!Better watch Special Ops in Hotstar. Its truly a masterpiece!!\n",
      "Review 289: It was excellent till episode 7 but the climax screwed everything. Worst ever climax. No logic..no storyline.no thought process\n",
      "Review 290: The lead actor is barely audible, he just mumble all the time.\n",
      "Review 291: Something different from terror based series and contains glimpse of future technology and mix of mythology made it interestingReally season 2 of most of series disappointed bt this is really worth watchingIt also gives logical ending to season 2 and still keeping space for season 3 and can be watched with family and also don't have abusive words.psychopath killer with a twisted philosophy deep-seated in Indian mythology is on the loose. Two forensic officers from the CBI are close on heals to catch the serial killer but with a twist of fate, they get caught in a dreadful situation. Must watch.\n",
      "Review 292: After watching first two episodes it was very clear to identify the main villain of this series. Saurav Shukla tried to create something new, which he did. But that doesn't make anything good. Arshad warsi and the team acted pretty well, but it was the ending.... the ending will make you feel that you have wasted 5;30 hours of your life. I have never saw this type of horrible ending. Even Game of thrones had a better ending than this.\n",
      "Review 293: Just awful. Every single actor in the show acts so bad. Literally 100's of plot holes. Please save your time and skip this unforgettable stupidness longing 8 episodes.\n",
      "Review 294: It had so many open ended loops. The acting of each actor was stellar but they story wasn't upto the mark. They introduced a lot of elements without pressing on them. 0 logic.\n",
      "Review 295: There is full exaggeration of Indian tv Drama(Ekta kapoor) . How can CBI be so helpless the way it is represented in this tv series . I dont understand why one govt body cant help anther govt body when it is a national threat and recognized. three words for Tv series and Voot player ridiculous , Total waste , Waste of time.\n",
      "Review 296: Can you please change the character Nikhil worst actor in the series speaking in mouth.All the time we have to go back and lesson to him again what he said in mouthI saw his other serials also no idea what is his problem dialogue delivery is worst then anything üòí\n",
      "Review 297: ASUR is an extremely well directed web series based on a very thought provoking story. It keeps the viewers captivated. The title completely justifies the story. The message has been portrayed in a brilliant way. Its super interesting. From the direction to acting to dialogues, everything is top notch!It's a must watch thriller.\n",
      "Review 298: This web series has been meticulously constructed to captivate its audience and draw them into the numerous facets of its plot. The detailed characteriszation of multiple characters and the constant weaving of plotlines throughout episodes demonstrate the show's extraordinary storytelling powers. The depiction of the devastation wrought by technological warfare in the programme is a sobering reminder of the far-reaching consequences of such combat. The film business should make more web series with screenplays of this calibre. As a result, I encourage the producers to complete Season 3 as soon as possible. Although the writing may use some work, Arshad Warsi's captivating performance as the protagonist saves the series.\n",

      "Review 300: There are probably more than 100 plot holes in this series.\n",
      "Review 301: I totally hate that nikhil character. Always he tried to be oversmart . Like he knows everything. Only first episode is worth watch and rest episode are completely crap. This show is nothing but a hype train. And train will get derailed after second seasom.\n",
      "Review 302: They did try, but feels completely forced. Loopholes in the story, crappy writing, illogical reasoning and still several sub par creative elements ruined what could have been a decent drama.I don't want to waste anymore time on the review and you should not waste anytime on this show.\n",
      "Review 303: Started this series with lots of hopes and excitement. The hysteria and suspense it built up in first 6 episodes were completely lost in last 2 episodes. You can feel the direction getting off track and illogical aimed to wrap up the series and unveil the evil characters overlooking sanity. Still I would recommend to watch it once though.Not to forget the show has so many errors too.\n",
      "Review 304: Everything related to this show: Acting, casting, direction, editing is just pathetic. It is very clear from most of the scenes that these guys did not do any research. They have got most of the details wrong. They show the guy smoking inside FBI building and he has an ashtray in his office. It is ridiculous. You cannot smoke inside a federal building! The spelling of calendar is wrong when it appears for the first time in a text message and then they corrected it. When arshad warsi is looking at the X-rays that show the index finger chopped off from multiple bodies he asks his team very seriously \"do you see a pattern\" I almost fell down laughing. Sorry for repeating but the acting is just PATHETIC!This show is total garbage.\n",
      "Review 305: Story was 8 out of ten. But acting & choreography was bad. And ending felt like far cry for another season.\n",

      "Review 308: Just three words,oh my god !! What a series!! What a start for Voot select! I've never seen such Indian tv series yet. The screenplay, direction, acting everything just brilliant. It's great combination of crime with mythology .\n",
      "Review 309: Was expecting more after seeing the imdb rating. It turned out to be rather disappointing..\n",
      "Review 310: Watch it for entertainment only. Used Hinduism for business as usual and presenting too many fake things related to Hinduism. It's a trend in Bollywood now to present Hinduism and it's flag holder people like Brahmins and Kshatriyas in bad manner\n",
      "Review 311: Asur tries to be something more than it is. It tries to be intellectual, it tries to give philosophical gyaan and it tries to have a thrilling plot. It fails on all counts.I can only understand the craze about Asur when it is compared to detective shows of the past.It is slightly better, it seems to be slightly more modern.But where it fails is to bridge the gap between the audience and the unrealistic plot.The acting falls flat, even from some of the more experienced actors like Arshad Warsi, and the characters twist and bend sometimes by having unnatural abilities and sometimes by being just at the right place at the right time, just to fit the plot.I can only give it a solid 5.\n",
      "Review 312: How to ruin a superb plot and base of a story by rubbish acting and making? This is it. An Absolute waste of time!\n",
      "Review 313: Good Work should be appreciated & Asur is Good Work. It's a blend of Mystery, Crime, Mythology with good performance from the Cast. Yet, Asur is far from Perfect as it is being type-casted in the reviews. The Story could have been 01 Episode Lesser & certain unwanted heroics could have been avoided. Certain point of the Story feels like the Director & Writer are indulging in their good work. However, Asur is a Must-Watch for its originality & an attempt to create a TV Series devoid of typical Indian Masala Entertainment.\n",
      "Review 314: Asur is more a psychology than a thriller and a detective. How are decisions made, how do decisions affect our loved ones and the world around us? Why do we value our loved ones less than we depend on them? What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.\n",
      "Review 315: The story is unique but not the execution.The direction, visuals, bgm and the acting is pretty ordinary.Definitely overhyped series.\n",
      "Review 316: Pushing human beings beyond their tolerance to draw out the animal out of them. The whole series is based on this philosophy.It is a chaotic world already and we try to control it with order. It is more biblical than vedic.I think I need a chat with the antagonist of the show. May be that the brilliance of Asur ,making you yell at the antagonist that your logic is flawed.Arshad Warsi is a disappointment,they should have picked up someone else for the role. There are many inconsistencies in the story but overall it is entertaining. The usage of curse words are unnecessary sometimes. If you can't blend curse words in a organic way then you are forcing it into a scene,it should be natural.\n",

      "Review 318: Amazing acting, good direction by Oni Sen. Season 2 must come\n",
      "Review 319: I have binged all the episodes of Asur It's so damn good. It's a little slow at points but gives you time to understand the story better and the Indian Mythology. So I didn't mind it.After a really long time saw a thriller hindi show, which held up till last.\n",
      "Review 320: Brilliant concept but execution could have been better\n",
      "Review 321: \"Antaha Asti Praranbha\" means the ending is the beginning. This show gives true meaning of this quate, the tagline. The scripting is so well written that its an edge of a seat show. The connection bewteen hindu Mythology and Technology specially with an AI is just phynominal.S02 is released after almost 3 years and still they maintained the quality of the show with such an ease like S01.Personally, i admired Thanos for his thought and dedication. Here, Asur is giving me the same vibe. Indian Cinema has many great shows but this show is above all (in my opinion). I am thrilled to observe how the makers pulled the story to the best.Kudos to the makers and hyped for S03. ü•Ç\n",
      "Review 322: Could have watched CID instead.i miss CID actually. How daya used to break doors and how Abhishek used to collect all information of every impossible things. So nostalgic.\n",
      "Review 323: No story , no logic.I was having high hopes on this show.Few actors performed well but because of week storyline the series is not able to hold the interest.\n",
      "Review 324: One of the best and awesome tvshows out there. Very engaging and exciting for young generation. Best to relax from everyday tension. Just get yourselves a pack of popcorns and chill watching it. The second season I would say is better than the previous one. It's very suspense full and the acting of the actors are also very goodüëç. Everyone did a great job and especially that kid ( Anant ). A great mix of mythology and technology which is very rare to see especially in Bollywood. The unique combination and blend makes it worth watching. It's not just for timepass but it's recommended according to me.\n",
      "Review 325: After watching this, I must say it is one of the fantastic psychological suspense thriller I have had ever seen! Every pitch and scene is so well placed in their space that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. And you will be super enthusiast to watch the next episode. The entire cast is magical with there mind-blowing performance. I binge-watched the entire season in just six hours. Its a master piece digital content in 2020 yet!\n",
      "Review 326: Just consider it to be a vocabulary test. Find all synonyms for pointless, foolish, ridiculous, illogical, and ..... and each will fully apply. There is creative license but if it degenerates into a divorce from reality, no sanity and children playing with toy sets seem more credible than the setups, it is then manifest incompetence. To add to the silliness looks like the scripting followed a laundry list of standard phrases eg i know how you feel - no you cannot, and mixed them in indiscriminately. After two episodes i ran it at 3x speed - thanks to a video speed adjustment extension. Waste of time.\n",
      "Review 327: The Plot of the Web Series is unique. Really marvelous.\n",
      "Review 328: The Series full of Suspense. Every Minute and Second you are thinking that what happened next. Great introduction of such of Psycho personality.\n",
      "Review 329: I'm seeing some low rated reviews. Don't get me wrong but i get it. Not many people can understand this type of plot and storyline.I do agree there were a few mistakes (2,3 only) happened opposing common sense. But keeping that aside, this is some Hollywood level stuff.Story is so fresh, so much research took place on mythology and forensic science. 8th episode could have been better but it's okay. I did enjoyed every minute of season. Arshad warsi, Barun and Vivesh were stars of the show. Waiting for season 2. Season one didn't end quite nicely.It's not your average thriller. So if that's your taste, stay away. If you looking for something new and ready to dig deep, you will definitely appreciate it.\n",
      "Review 330: Its a fashion to show Hindu religion Hindu beliefs in bad light, They dont have the balls to read Quran interpret it and come up with a killer's story. Now with no censorship OTT is a free run for all perverts. Here a half baked potato Gaurav SHUKLA the creator who interprets the scriptures in his own way and comes up with the story of a serial killer taking refuge behind whats written n scriptures and eulogising a petty serial killer who is on a kiling spree deriving sadistic pleasure. It is basically a revenge story camouflaged by a sick mind. There's no thrlil except for those who find killing of people in a gruesome manner, thrilling. in nut shell it can be termed as \"Confessions of a dangerous mind\".\n",
      "Review 331: Zodiac, Other Hollywood murder mysteries, SAW movie & climax was like Dark Knight style. Blend them all.. you will get Asur. When you watch it you will understand. Well written taught thriller. Engaging .. if you like murder mystery go for it.\n",
      "Review 332: Basically I like only two things about this series..First mythological narration part !Second theme music !Rest acting, editing, dialogues and Storyline all are below average and chracters building is also poor !In this series it has shown that the vilian is someone who is super genius and brainy guy but in reality you will not feel the same because non of the planning and plotting of this super vilian excites you, infact it all seems irrational and by the end of the series it become more worse to tolerate nonsense !So if you are in lockdown period and you are looking to kill your time without being offended with stupidity then you can watch this overhyped and high rated series !\n",
      "Review 333: 1. Sloppy acting. This show 8 hours of substandard acting2. The show has no track of day and night, logic is a missing flavor here3. Subtle push of propaganda and bashing of Hindu beliefs. It doesn't stop here, it uses push of left propaganda. Inadvertent hinduphobia which the online shows are full of also present4. No understanding of the Hindu history ( they keep shouting mythology in the show)5. Endorsing books that put the faith in bad light\n",
      "Review 334: Bad and rigid acting, bad plot, bad casting and bad execution. For a thriller/horror this series fails completely to invoke any suspense to push on further.

      "Review 338: Absolutely amazing. Top notch acting of Arshad & the young Subh. This series is taking some serious issues of AI controlling humans without even letting them know that. If one web series needs to be watched by everyone, it'll be this. Mythology is blended with technology in perfect way. That dark web leveraging criminals is shown appropriately. One of the guys was using inbuilt chat of online games to deliver secret messages. How technology can led to the end of Kalyug is presented in a commendable manner. Slowly, but steadily, we all are becoming slaves of technological advances. Asur is the Godfather of all web series in India.\n",
      "Review 339: First of all sorry if title for review is misleading üòÖ. But this series is must watch, beautifully written, amazingly developed using indian mythological concepts. If anyone wants mystery combined with edge seat thrilling experience give this series a try. It takes sometime to establish but trust me it's worth it.\n",
      "Review 340: Good Story, Direction. Performance is also good, but don't know why director given importance to actor's Barun Sobti. His performance was awful, couldn't hear his voice clearly, dialog delivery was poor.\n",
      "Review 341: Predictable plot... Worst climax.. Not so good acting.. And very annoying bgm... I don't get the hype and good reviews honestly.. Ya concept was good but the forensic thing didn't really grip me in.. And to be honest there were a lot of plot holes.. Well nice try anyway\n",
      "Review 342: Absolutely Rubbish Ending n poor Direction, poor DOP poor everything in the last two episodes..Don't waste Ur time\n",
      "Review 343: The amount of IT Powers shown in this show are absolutely unrealistic and at that in India, to be honest if India had half of that IT infrastructure there would have been no crime at all let alone India i think whole world could be crime less, and with that amount of IT powers the institutions don't have that skilled operators so they called some one from outside to operate it and on top of that there is no team of IT just single guy at a time \"let me laugh for a second\". Acting of the IT guys look very unnatural specially of the character played by Naina. Data can be breached of anyone at anytime. Absolutely Disaster.\n",

Bt for a regular viewer who watches \"Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah\" types of garbage on everyday basis, trust me u gonna enjoy the show. No wonder, u lose interest after watching the pilot. Then, again u gonna tell ur mind something interesting might hid in Ep 2; Bt u will suck again. So...dont go for the review, this not worth it ....\n",

      "Review 350: Only want to belittle Hindu mythology. Wrong implication by the series. Story telling was at it best but a few misconceptions were carried till the end of the series. On top of that the series end on a cliff hanger and just trying to earn money. Waste of time and brain power trying to decode the series.\n",
      "Review 351: What sacred games failed to deliver , asur did it flawlessly.This is one of the best crime thriller with psychological and mythological contrast .

      "Review 354: Not to mention actors, directors, and musicians. The programme is entertaining and worth seeing. I'm looking forwards to Season 2. After viewing the entire season, I feel confident providing a summary of this show. Now that I've seen the show for myself, I can confidently declare that it's top-notch and among the best in the world. It captivates the attention and holds it in a trance of wonder. People from all across the world, not just those in India, need to see it. The writing by Gaurav Shukla and his colleagues is excellent. Excellent direction was provided by Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen. The performances of Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, SharibHashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh are outstanding. People are profoundly moved by the show. I'm looking forwards to seeing what happens in season 2.\n",
      "Review 355: This series is not just a thriller. It plays with your mind. The story line builds up well and midway through the series leaves you wanting for more! This show is a \"psychological thriller\" in its true sense. Irresistible. If you still haven't watched it, you should start right away!\n",

      "Review 365: This series will make your jaw drop. Arshad Warsi , Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Sharib Hashmi put up enthralling performances. The screenplay and dialogue is brilliant. The series is shot in real locations and it keeps you mesmerized. The references to Indian mythology left me thinking about the series for a long period of time. I finished it in one night I just couldn't stop watching after Episode 1. Lots of context and thrill.\n",

      "Review 368: The series had lot of flaws from the beginning but the last episode is written by a child and the director had no clue how to handle a childish story. Total waste of time. Poor acting, poor and unclear dialogue delivery, poor plot.\n",
      "Review 369: Cliche- using indian mythology has become a trend. But they don't know how to use it like sacred games used it in 1st season. Many loopholes in the story. Wish they had thought the whole series through before making changing the rules constantly. It's like everything is made in such a way that it favours the antagonist.Arshad Warsi and Barun sobti give good performances but that's about it !\n",
      "Review 370: ASUR! The best Indian series I've watched . Starting with the story , it's just like a roller coaster ride with full of mystery, suspense and thrill for sure . And what a superb acting by arshad warsi , we all have seen him mostly in a comic way but in asur he steals the show.\n",
      "Review 371: What a series. The best webseries for me from India till now. Highly recommended. Plz dont forget this to watch.\n",
      "Review 372: The first seasons of Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon were, in my opinion, the greatest Indian internet series. Voot claims that ASUR is the greatest Indian online serial of all time. \"The Very Best\" is as realistic, severe, and terrifying as its title indicates. You will be unable to abandon your stations. There are no big commercial breaks throughout either Voot choose or this online series. But trust me when I say this: in the world of Indian online series and television, it's the genuine deal. I've never written such a glowing review of a movie or web series before. The development of Indian film and television is quite encouraging. We've always relied on talented actors, but these days stories are starting to matter more to filmmakers as well. The standard of our material is likewise rising. To sum up, it was great.\n",
      "Review 373: Asur has blown up my mind like never before. I haven't seen such smart and intriguing writing in Indian web series before. It involves Mythology, Psychology, Murders, Science, Investigation, Forensics in such a deep and detailed way that you can't even imagine. The storytelling and the screenplay are accurate and once you start watching the 1st ep. there's no looking back. Dialogues and performances are just awesome and make the show way better. Connecting the two worlds- Logical reasoning and Myth is the most impressive part. Forget Sacred games & Mirzapur, Now This has become my most favorite Indian Web series of all time. Watch and thank me later! ‚ù§\n",

      "Review 376: In today's high-tech, scientific world where we're becoming more alienated and lonely, how susceptible are we to people who, on the surface, appear pleasant and sensible but who, in fact, have their own agenda, power over you, and are ready to influence your thoughts and minds? A few nail-biting action sequences with real stakes give the film an unusual flavour. The story follows the hero through a series of interconnected scenarios set in exotic locations where he must conduct body searches. Superior in appearance and performance! For fans of suspense, this is a must-see. Now that I've seen the entire season, I can confidently describe this show. Incredible, Fantastic, and Mind-Blowing.\n",

      "Review 378: Anyone could tell who can be murderer from first episode.Not suspenseful as expected. Extremely boring and wastage of time. Climax is extremely ruined Anyone can guess what may happen next.Almost every person's acting was not justified except Arhsad, child shubh and lorak.Even varun sobti being big tv actor could not justify. His wife's role is very irritating.Don't compare it with sacred game. Sacred game is far better than this.\n",
      "Review 379: The only thought throughout the web series was what the hell is happening! This is worst uneven coordinatied tv series I have ever seen! I mean they have made joke out of security organisations like FBI and CBI! this is a dumb show! DONT WATCH!\n",
      "Review 380: I wish I could mark the entire series on a negative scale. I mean seriously, what was it! The 1st 2 episodes did keep me interested but from the 3rd one, I just lost the plot. CBI is shown in such low light, the characters, an utter nonsense. New concept but truly failed in execution. And the last episode is hilariously bad. So many loopholes. Could I just undo the lost time in my life. God, save the people who are planning to binge watch it. I just hope you come out alive.\n",
      "Review 381: A contrived concoction of Hindu mythology, the movie Saw and a few CSI procedures... A few plot twists are decent but they don't help the gaping holes existing in the writing. Production values are ordinary, acting pedestrian. Asur overall is a very underwhelming experience. I could go on pointing out the dozens of inconsistencies in the script, I could point out stupid cliches which are all over the place but none of them matter because finally we have a wannabe who got lost all over they place.\n",
      "Review 382: Gave 9 stars to this. But need to drop it to 6. Coding, hacking, law, government agencies all have become a joke to this show. Why do makers always choke while making second edition? Naina is some kind of legend, knows everything from hacking to breaching in just few minutes. Forensic experts are doing work of CBI officials and police. First season was way better and appealing. But funny part is, why do Barun Sobti look like he hasn't taken shower for ages in both the seasons but others look absolutely fresh? I still can't digest the fact that forensic experts have so much power in CBI. :(((((\n",
      "Review 383: When i not watched true detective , i believe that what a nice web-series, but later i found this web series is actually inspired by True Detective, and the creater and script writer only did the job to how to fit the frame of true detective as indian way nothing much also they also show there dirty mind .As compared to True Detective ( where as it not a family watch) this Asur didnt not sit any where near .\n",
      "Review 384: The concept of a software engineer doing ping google on a terminal window and saying she is expert in hacking is a mere example of how bad is the screenplay.Except Sharib Hashmi, everyone's acting is below par. Yes even Arshad Warsi's .For such a powerful concept how can Dhananjay Rajput move on without really showing remorse after hearing his wife's death. At the worst, Barun Sobti's acting is terrible and misplaces the motive of putting the character Nikhil Nair in the script.Personally for me the ending was so hapless that I kept wondering how the majority is tempted to weigh above 8 for this series.I am sure season 2 will be released and unless there is a change in the casting, screenplay writing and director, i am not wasting 5 years of my idle time.\n",

      "Review 389: Asur Season 2 is a well-made and suspenseful thriller. The performances are top-notch, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti giving particularly memorable turns. The story is well-paced and keeps you guessing until the very end.The series does a good job of blending mythology and technology. The use of Vedas and other ancient texts to explain the killer's motives is both fascinating and chilling.The series also explores the dangers of artificial Intelligence, and how it could be used for evil purposes...Here are some of the pros and cons of the series:Pros:*Great performances*Well-paced story*Suspenseful*Thought-provoking*Blends mythology and technologyCons:-Some of the VFX are subpar-A few plot holes.\n",
      "Review 390: As a witness, I can say with confidence that the performance is first-rate. The film has to be released worldwide, not just in India. The creator and writer, Gaurav Shukla, has done a lot. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal are the authors of this work. This is the most suspenseful series I've ever read. You can't help but speculate about what'll occur next. Excellent context for comprehending the Psycho protagonist. The moment I laid eyes on this show, I knew it was perfect for me. The web series's intriguing quality is amplified by the originality of its story premise. I like telling my friends about this amazing web series.\n",
      "Review 391: I love the writer of this Series and Arshad Warsi's character execution is tremendous.\n",
      "Review 392: Asur 2 is an excellent mythological thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat with each new episode. It's always the same villen plotting against DhanjayRajpoot and his group. Arshad Warsi does a fantastic job with the role. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh have been through this together. The mythical themes and the show's concept (AI for anticipating user conduct) complement one other quite well. The rest of the cast did a fantastic job as well, however several filler episodes stretched the tale out until episode 8. This programme might have been great for an entire season if the episodes were shorter. The whole 30-minute episode of Hacking, in which Anupriya Goenka executes programmes made by geeks for geeks (as a form of fun), would feature Goenka.\n",

      "Review 398: The complexity of Asur's performance defies simplification. Some people can effortlessly convey a wide range of emotions by a simple glance. Smart forensics expert who recently started a family and is having a hard time adjusting to life with his Fearsome Asur wife and two small kids. This riveting thriller had me on the edge of my seat. The writing maintains a high level of suspense throughout. One of my favourite aspects of the whole thing was the soundtrack, which was produced and played wonderfully by BickramGhosh. The final scene, set to this score, gave me chills. Recently completed the film Asur. The contributions of mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology to the creation and presentation of this masterpiece are unmistakable; bravo to all involved. Every syllable was absorbed by me.\n",
      "Review 399: One of the best Bollywood films ever made, in my view. Incredible performance, but my personal favourite is that of Dr. Barun Sobti. My interest in Bollywood media has been piqued by this excellent online series, which ranks among the best I've seen recently. I appreciate the efforts of the actors and crew and I hope Season 2 is as good as the first. It's a masterpiece, and you should definitely see it; there are no spoilers here, but I'm tempted to reveal one anyway. This book is not just another thriller; it stands on its own. Your mind will be fooled by it. The story really starts to take off and get interesting at the halfway point of the series. This is a \"psychological thriller\" in every sense of the term.\n",

      "Review 401: Very different tabs new kind of story. Filled with suspense and has you guessing what will happen next. Climax was very poor. They didn't tie everything together very well. Otherwise very much recommend for people to watch.\n",
      "Review 402: The story is illogical and similar to old Indian movies. 8.5 is not deserving for this kind of series. Whenever you watch it you feel like you're forced to experience thrillness. Illogical scenes with bad acting.\n",
      "Review 403: Crime thriller is a personal favorite genre of mine, So when I heard raving reviews for this web series, I had to watch it. And it is damn good. The acting was solid by everyone especially Varun Sobti & Vishesh Bansal. But its the direction & writing which are the stars here. Pitting Forensic Science against Indian Mythology is a genius idea. Although the last episode was underwhelming ,still it is one of the best web series to come out of India.\n",
      "Review 404: Barun sobati you earned one genuine fans this time as you gave the BEST performance of your acting career till now. He left me speechless Must watch\n",
      "Review 405: I do not hate this series but it seems to predictable to me. The fact the nearly everyone is promoting this bugs me. Then I took a look at the IMDB rating which is important for many users and boom reviews after reviews of nothing just not like characteristics. The fact that the killer killed Dhananjay's wife and filmed it with 4 perspectives bugged me.Nikhil and DJ and every character's except Nusrat fake and weird English lingo bugged me. And then finally when DJ was sent to jail without any trial infuriated me.I mean you made a below average series that's alright but what's with the hype. Stop meddling with the review section man. The the fact that people are watching this is because it claims \"9 star on IMDB\". But that's unfair.If you think I overdid something go and watch family man you will understand somethings atleast branding isn't fake.Highly disappointed.Arshad warsi's below average acting made me reconsider my favourite actors.\n",
      "Review 406: Asur season 2 is a masterpiece of Indian thriller web series. It picks up from where the first season left off, with the cat-and-mouse game between forensic expert Nikhil Nair and the serial killer Shubh. The plot is full of twists and turns, keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats. The performances of the cast are brilliant, especially Arshad Warsi as Dhananjay Rajput and Barun Sobti as Nikhil Nair. The cinematography, music and direction are also top-notch. The show explores the themes of mythology, psychology and morality in a captivating way. Asur season 2 is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good thriller.I give it 10/10 stars.\n",
      "Review 407: The new series by Voot is titled \"asur,\" which means \"evil,\" alluding to the origins of evil in people. When one item is more important than another. The ferocity from inside that can save your life. Some people may share your views while others may have strong objections. This piece of wistful writing is superb. Over the course of the eight parts, the story becomes increasingly fascinating. The writing, direction, and acting are all top-notch. The entire output of the team is outstanding. It's a must that you follow these rules. Just three words: \"holy crap!\" Incredible, huh? What a fantastic beginning for the Vote select method! I've never seen anything like that on Indian television before. The script, the direction, the acting-everything-is excellent. It's effective in blending crime with mythology.\n",
      "Review 408: This series keeps u at the edge of your seat.The sets and the chemistry of the cast is great.Must watch.\n",
      "Review 409: There was a problem with the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torment someone else. Asur is written superbly; I was left guessing till the very end. I'veseen everything there is to see in Asur. Excellent, in my opinion. The pace drags at times, but the story's exploration of Indian mythology and its central themes make the wait worthwhile. That's why I had no unease about it. Finally, after a long wait, I was able to see a gripping and suspenseful Hindi thriller. Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur, this time on a digital screen for the benefit of the audience and the fans. This film has an excellent story and directing. The synchronisation of the actors' actions is flawless. To make it a night to remember, everyone gave 100% of their efforts. Gaurav Shukla, I adore your creative writing. On top of that, I'dappreciate it if you'd share my warmest regards with Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I can't wait to dive into the next project.\n",
      "Review 410: This webseries is the best combo of mythology, present world and crime. It will let you know about pros of cons of everything you do. It also enhance the concept of KARMA.\n",
      "Review 411: Please don't waste your time you will depressed your self totally. its psychopathic story. i think writer is the asur. stupid story and total psycho.\n",
      "Review 412: The series is brilliant till episode 7 but in the final 8 th episode they just loose the climax... It feels why the hell did I took the pain to watch all the other episodes... They had no clue of what they wanted to achieve or convey in the end... The climax is as sick as the thinking of its villain... Very disappointed... You just lost it where it mattered!!!\n",
      "Review 413: Every episode of Asur 2 exposes more about the crafty villagers of Villen who continue to deceive DhanjayRajpoot and his gang, elevating it to the peak of legendary tension. Arshad Warsi delivered an outstanding performance as the well-written character. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are in the same boat. The program's famed storyline is a good fit for artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction. The remainder of the Starcast has also done well, however the tale drags on unnecessarily until episode 8. The programme may have lasted longer than its first season if the episodes had been properly edited. An UpriyaGoenka Hacking Scenes Compilation The session will take only 30 minutes, and she will (ironically) run applications intended expressly for computer nerds.\n",
      "Review 414: Despite having a strong plot base, the cast & crew totally wasted everything. Absolute Rubbish. Don't listen to the other propagandists positive reviewers. Watch something else.\n",
      "Review 415: Starry good, Later It was a torture....Un-necessary director tried to pull story to 8 episodes....After death of Aditya Jalan, Story dies...when Arshad Warsi did not bothers to check how his Instinct was leaked to Killer.....\n",
      "Review 416: This show is outstanding. Loved the story line and the natural acting of the characters. Everything is executed in such a good way. It's a perfect blend of action ,drama and interesting twists. i ended up watching the whole season in a day.Definitely recommended for people wanting to watch different kind of genre. Loved it.\n",
      "Review 417: It builds up with so much promise, but loose writing at the end makes it a below par show. Way too many twists at the end makes it nauseating to watch. Nikhil choosing life of 3 strangers over his daughter's life is utter nonsense. This was purely done for the sake of a twist without any empathy.\n",
      "Review 418: Came across this piece of crap through some colleagues who suggested. Its on voot app,no wonder the app for shows like roadies, splitsvilla etc. So the kind of audience giving it 9+/10 is justified.Coming to the point, poor performances, poor direction, disorganized plot, predictable plot and about thousand of technical and logical mistakes throughout the show. A wannabe attempt , taking references from dexter, silence of lambs etc. All intelligent viewers can skip while someone who doesn't care about good cinema can waste their time.\n",
      "Review 419: First of all, i can't forget this series. The crime in this movie is not bearable for me. The murders are not entertaining for me. I think this thing is taken so easy in this series.I would say the crime is taken so easy and normal in the whole series. So please make the content softer. I just take it as an average.\n",
      "Review 420: ASUR.. one of the finest web series ever I saw with perfect blend of detailed forensic nd dark deep psychological aspects.\n",
      "Review 421: Asur can't be describe in one word with respect to its performance . Simple single look but very deep emotions been portrayed so easily. Intelligent forensic expert to family man, a caring father and husband to a Scary Asur whom he becomes at fight with emotions.\n",
      "Review 422: What a spine chilling series I've come a crossed. A Crime Thriller based on Hindu Mythology with an antagonist been showed not only brutal but always 2 steps ahead then the Protagonist which can easily go head to head with the Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes & Jigsaw in SAW.Solid Screenplay with fair direction along with the leading performance of Arshad Warsi to whom now I call a seasoned actor, supported well by all the supporting cast in which I should mention Barun Sobti.Comprised of 8 episodes the VOOT has produced so far the best which I've only seen priory from WEST. Series is already getting critical acclaim from critiques and masses\".\n",
      "Review 423: Dont waste your time. There are too many plot holes and bad acting...\n",
      "Review 424: Quite a good movie... Storyline is terrific but the way it unfolds is quite complicated... Arshad Warsi as DJ is brilliant.. Varun sobti could do better.. All other actors have done justice to their roles... There are some loopholes in the story.. Climax is not as good as I thought it would be but it's OK... I would say it's a watchable movie..P. S :- It's my first review ever.. üôè\n",
      "Review 425: An intriguing crime thriller with a unique story, and brilliant performances. Definitely raised the expectations for the second season.\n",
      "Review 426: Nothing great about it. Crackdown was way better..\n",
      "Review 427: In the moment where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a character, there is an editing error. Asur is fantastic in every way; the writing alone had me guessing till the very end. I watched every episode of Asur in one sitting. This is incredible. The pacing is a little slow at times, but this just allows you more time to absorb the Indian mythology and narrative. So I was okay with it. I finally saw a Hindi thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat till the finish. Arshad Warsi returns to the big screen with Asur, much to the joy of his fans. This film's writing and direction are both excellent. All of the performers had perfect timing. Everyone involved did their utmost to make it memorable. Gaurav Shukla deserves credit for his well-written piece. Thank you also to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the amazing team. I'm waiting for the next task.\n",
      "Review 428: #AsurRating:8.5/10Review:Asur is both headed this web series brilliantly and compelling enough to binge-watch it at one go.It also consists well written elements of suspense, thrill and unexpected twists.The performances are strong , credible and exciting concept make Asura a watchable thriller.#Voot\n",
      "Review 429: The concept is very nice loved watching arsad warsi after a long time on screen again. The concept of two worlds and their fight with a dark side is amazing. The bio of this itself made me watch it without watching the trailer.\n",
      "Review 430: Asur 2 is an excellent mythological thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat with each new episode. It's always the same villen plotting against DhanjayRajpoot and his group. Arshad Warsi does a fantastic job with the role. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh have been through this together. The mythical themes and the show's concept (AI for anticipating user conduct) complement one other quite well. The rest of the cast did a fantastic job as well, however several filler episodes stretched the tale out until episode 8. This programme might have been great for an entire season if the episodes were shorter. The whole 30-minute episode of Hacking, in which Anupriya Goenka executes programmes made by geeks for geeks (as a form of fun), would feature Goenka.\n",
      "Review 431: New series on #voot; don't be misled by the name; \"asur\" means \"evil.\" This series explores the roots of asur, or evil, in the human brain. Priorities shift as circumstances change. In what ways your inner asur will go to ensure your safety. It's likely that others won't see the merit in your proposal that you do. This is a fantastically written tale of the macabre. There are eight episodes altogether, and they all get progressively more interesting. Everything about it, from the storyline to the performances, blew me away. The group's efforts, taken as a whole, are very impressive. A must-see in every sense. What the heck!! Is sufficient to solve the problem. Wow, that's a lot of stuff. Wow, this is a great beginning for Voot choose. There has never been an American broadcast of an Indian television show like this before. Excellent writing, directing, and acting. This blend of mystery and legend is stunning.\n",
      "Review 432: Very poor directions. There are a lot of flaws in the direction. Screenplay and acting is good, but not the direction and cinematography.\n",
      "Review 433: The web series goes beyond our expectations. Story, cast, screenplay, it reigns over all series in every aspect. This is a completely new concept and the implementation of this is terrific. After getting overwhelmed by the season 1, everyone was eagerly waiting for season 2. The perfect blend of mythology and technology is awesomely depicted here. In every scene, the writer always goes beyond your thinking level. The research of facts behind the series is outstanding. Modern science and technology is the touchstone of this series. Finally I want to say that everyone will feel proud to be an indian while watching the series.THIS IS A MUST WATCH!\n",
      "Review 434: One of the best engaging Web Series of India but underrated also. Season 2 is a mixture of Science Hindu Mythology and Season 1 based on only Mythologyconcept. It represents the story in engaging form with suspense. Asur shows how can be the technology used in devastation of world in a wrong way (Darkweb). The use (AI))Artificial intelligence,( Deepfake) for making fake videos of anyone anyone and apps takes permissions from their users illegally by installing apps or giving permissions of phones. It shows the future predictions like the use of sonic boom bomb, etc.A Anime name MONSTER is also made on this type concept but completely different. Both are different but I Like ASUR.\n",
      "Review 435: Poor casting and even poorer acting performances ruined a nicely thought original plot.\n",
      "Review 436: This is a fantastic production in every way imaginable, from the acting to the writing to the set design to the music to the tale. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, AnupriyaGoenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, MeiyangChang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra were all outstanding in their roles. A lot of people will enjoy this programme. It's the kind of show that stays with you, challenging your sense of right and wrong and whether or not your own moral standards are fair. The gap between myth and the present world has been greatly narrowed by this show. I think it's great, and you should watch it; I'm really looking out to season 3. There isn't a dull moment in this mind-blowing suspense thriller. The trailer does not do the film credit. Incredible music and a well-crafted story that incorporates mythology, psychology, forensics, and more. Do not pass up this opportunity.\n",
      "Review 437: The way it started till the way it ended everytime there was a new kind of suspense. A power pact thriller with a mystical blend of science and mythology presented in an oscillating manner. Hats off to the whole team for producing such a content. We need more like this.\n",
      "Review 438: Everyone present did their whole best to make it a memorable evening. We really appreciate how well written this is, and we have Gaurav Shukla to thank. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team should also be commended for their outstanding work. It's time to move on to the next assignment. It was wonderful to have arsad warsi back on television after such a lengthy absence, and the concept is quite innovative. The concept of good and evil forces from two parallel worlds is intriguing. Even before I watched the trailer, the summary had me interested in seeing the film. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, both professionals in their fields, engage in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with the serial killer only known as \"Asur.\" At various periods in our lives, we are forced to evaluate our most fundamental ideas, beliefs, and values, as well as the decisions we make when faced with apparently insurmountable obstacles.\n",
      "Review 439: Mind bending.....Thrill and suspense.....Excellent webseries.... This series has proved that Indian Web series are top in the world...Story, screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, background score.....Everything is excellent...... A must watch for webserver lovers of crime, mystery genre.\n",
      "Review 440: Good plot with an average Execution! I think we need to encourage such movies! We discourage these kind of movies and like nonsense movies like \" Zodiac\" und \" Seven\" of Hollywood where except the director no one knows what the hell is going on!!!\n",
      "Review 441: Asur 2 is the ultimate mythological thriller since each episode unveils fresh truths. It's always the same band of evil men that con Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team. Arshad Warsi did an excellent job in the well-written part. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are both in the same situation. The program's base (the use of AI to predict and assess user action) and the inclusion of a legendary theme are a perfect fit for the show's plot. Other members of the Starcast have also done an excellent job, however the tale drags on until episode 8 due to unneeded, lengthy portions. The programme may have finished after six seasons if the episodes had been more closely trimmed. Aside from that, the show will only last around 30 minutes and will feature her performing algorithms designed by geeks for geeks.\n",
      "Review 442: You put an end to it, Arshad Warsi. The notion is brilliant, and the picture is superbly directed. Every single performer delivered an outstanding performance. Asur, the finest Hindi online serial of all time, has come to an end. It combines scientific research with Hindu beliefs. Wow, amazing work, buddy! When will the sequel be released? Asur will receive all of the awards this year. This web series has received a perfect score of 10 out of 10 for all areas, including acting, production, and plot. And to think I've only just done... I intend to watch it now that I know all of the episodes will be available soon. They were delivered on Saturday. I still haven't recovered... What is the origin of Kali? Will this ever come to an end? The author's amazing wordcraft will keep you guessing about what occurs next. Please, creators and publishers, don't take too long; I'm praying.\n",
      "Review 443: The is so good the it will blow your mind and heart away and hand off to all the acters for sure a great job. Worth watching and don't mind about the negative views . The story is amazing and beautiful writing and its is just mind blowing . All the episode are fast and not slow going and it will keep you on the edge of your sit and . You can watch it with your family and all the quality of episode can be noted in a good way and a good way to learn about Indian mythology and you love the show and the mythology of India no more words to describe it . Just go and watch it for yourself and with your friends and family.\n",
      "Review 444: Asur's second season is a great example of the suspenseful genre. The acting is excellent, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti giving notable performances. The story progresses quickly and keeps the reader guessing until the very end. The programme seamlessly blends mythology and science. The author's use of ancient books such as the Vedas to explain the killer's reasons is both interesting and scary. The potential for artificial intelligence to be utilised for evil is also examined in the series. Some of the series' benefits and drawbacks are as follows: Pros: *Excellent acting* *A taut, suspenseful, and thought-provoking plot* *combines folklore with modern technologies Disadvantages: -Poor visual effects (VFX) -There are a few kinks in the story.\n",
      "Review 445: Everyone involved did their utmost to make it memorable. Gaurav Shukla deserves credit for his well-written piece. Thank you also to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the amazing team. I'm waiting for the next task. The concept is great. I was overjoyed to see ArsadWarsi return to the big screen after what felt like a lifetime. It's amazing how the concept of two universes combating evil can work. Even before I watched the trailer, the synopsis of the film drew me in. Asur is more than just another crime thriller about forensics experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti's investigation of a serial murderer. It compels us to evaluate our guiding beliefs and the judgements we make in the most challenging of circumstances.\n",
      "Review 446: In this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming increasingly alienated and lonely, are we more vulnerable to individuals who appear lovely and rational but in fact are following their own agenda, seeking control over you, willing to bend your thoughts and minds to do their bidding? A limited number of action passages sandwiched by tense horror produce exotic suspense. This action film is the greatest in a series in which the main character takes front stage and investigates horrible deaths in remote locations with breathtaking landscapes. Very cleverly thought and executed. Fans of the genre should not miss this. After watching the full season, I believe I am qualified to contribute some descriptive terminology about this show. MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC STUNNING BREATHTAKING.\n",
      "Review 447: After seeing the show, I can confidently say that it is exceptional and among the greatest in the world. It should not just be shown to Indian audiences, but to the entire world. Both Gaurav Shukla, the creator, and Gaurav Shukla, the writers, did an outstanding job. NirenH. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The series Thrilling and Thrilling. Every waking minute, you worry what will happen next. Psycho's character was introduced effectively. I was fascinated from the first time I saw this series. It's great, and the idea is both exciting and baffling, making for an engaging web series. Because it'sso excellent, I've been telling all of my friends about this web series.\n",

      "Review 449: Thrilled... Each episode is thrilling... Finally Indian webseries are gearing up... Waiting for S2\n",
      "Review 450: Asur 2 is the pinnacle of mythological tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat with each new episode's revelations about the cunning villagers of Villen who continue to mislead Dhanjay Rajpoot and his gang. Arshad Warsi performed an excellent job as the well-written character. Amey Wagh and Varun Arora are in the same boat. The classic narrative and the program's underlying principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) are a perfect match. The rest of the cast has also done well, however the story drags on excessively until episode 8. If the editing had been better, this show may have finished after the first season. Anupriya Goenka's Hacking Scenes Will Be Collected The show will be only 30 minutes long, and she will be (jokingly) executing scripts created by geeks for geeks.\n",
      "Review 451: When it comes to efficacy, Asur defies concise summarization. It only took one glance, yet the amount of emotion transmitted was astounding. At day, he is a brilliant forensics specialist; at night, he is a devoted father and husband to a Scary Asur wife with whom he strives to reconcile. What an incredible thriller this was. The script keeps the audience interested throughout the film. Bickram Ghosh performed an excellent job with the soundtrack, which was one of my favourites. I got chills at the final credits with the tune. I recently finished seeing Asur. The team, performers, and crew have brilliantly blended their understanding of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterwork. I truly enjoyed it.\n",
      "Review 452: Well directed crime investigation series. Story, acting , suspense - all of the aspect of this series is good. I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is no moment that you will feel bored. All the credit goes to the writer and the director.The actors did very good job too. Asur takes the Indian series to another level. Worth of my time. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Review 453: Don't be fooled by the word; \"asur\" means \"evil.\" As a series name, it alludes to the birth of the asur, or evil, within the human mind. The shifting of priorities. How far your inner asur will go to defend you. It's conceivable that your concept is true for you but not for others. A brilliantly crafted gloomy story. There are eight episodes in total, and each one takes you deeper into the narrative. Everything, from the storyline to the performances, astonished me. The group's collective work is simply amazing. It's an absolute must-see. Oh my goodness!! Is all that is required. Isn't that a long series? What a fantastic start for Voot choose! Such an Indian television show has never aired in the United States. The script, direction, and acting were all excellent. It's an excellent combination of mystery and folklore.\n",
      "Review 454: Musicians, Filmmakers, and Actors. It's definitely worth a look. Season two is eagerly anticipated. After watching the full season, I believe I am qualified to contribute some descriptive terminology about this show. STUNNING BREATHTAKING MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC After seeing the show, I can confidently say that it is exceptional and among the finest in the world. It should not just be shown to Indian audiences, but to the entire world. Both Gaurav Shukla, the creator, and Gaurav Shukla, the writers, did an outstanding job. The remarkable performances of Arshad Warsi, BarunSobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh. If you see the show, it will leave an unforgettable impression on your mind. I'mlooking forwards to Season 2.\n",
      "Review 455: The lack of vulgarity and foul language distinguishes this series. The entire family may join in on the excitement. Set aside seven to eight hours of your time to watch this series; you will not be disappointed. Finally, the acting and cinematography are both excellent. There is not a single weak link in the entire series. Asur's positive feedback is greatly earned. There isn't a single weak link here. My Asur hangover has taken hold. The music at the start and end is pretty spooky. It's still playing in my head. To be honest, it's one of the best concerts I've ever seen. Everything about it was fantastic, including the storyline, direction, and acting. Asur was done in one sitting. This is the first time I've ever binge-watched a whole Web series in one day. Finally, a clever programming that can compete with westerns. Please accept my thanks for putting on such a terrific concert.\n",
      "Review 456: What a show....Story covering Indian mythology leading to a psycho thriller about a serial killer... Horror, thriller, drama, subtle emotions.... all is there...You will fall in love with the series...A MUST WATCH.PS - why people are rating it low, because it is not by Amazon Prime? Why I see this pattern!!! Sad.\n",
      "Review 457: Do you remember how you felt while solving crimes with BBC's Sherlock? Do you remember how you felt, while watching Oldboy? Do you remember the sheer irony and helplessness that Joker left on his enemies? Well, now India has Asur, a dark webseries about crime, psychopathy, human nature. It will dismantle all your notions about right and wrong. Although this genre of the series is not very new, but coming from Indian cinema it is breath of fresh air. More so, the series makes it relatable to the Indian audience, with all the layers of grey and evil. Its very similar to satanic beliefs, the idea of evil lies within everybody- they just need to be pushed enough. The mythical \"Asur\" of this series pushes ypur buttons to fall in their traps, and make drastic choices while mocking your own helplessness, guilt, evil. This series is very clear about its motives, as in you know who the villain is from the beginning. But it makes it difficult to find him in the current time, while he is running a crime ring that is hell bent to show you your true colors...\n",
      "Review 458: Each & everyone associated to it gave best to make it unforgettable. Special thanks to Gaurav Shukla for the great piece of writing art. Also to great work of Niren Bhatt ,Abhijit & complete team. Waiting for the next project.\n",
      "Review 459: Its a great watch. But the last episode was a bit disappointment otherwise it would have been 10 by 10 rating.\n",
      "Review 460: Because of the acting, writing, structure, aesthetics, music, and, yes, plot, it's a fantastic show. All of the performers, from Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti to Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, have performed admirably. There is no question that this show will win the award. It's the type of show that makes you ponder if the things you take for granted are truly right. In its fusion of mythology and technology, this series has gone deep beyond the surface. I can't rave about it enough; you should absolutely check it out. A mind-blowing suspense thriller that will keep you guessing till the very end. The trailer does not do the film justice. Mythology, psychology, forensics, a superb score, and a well-thought-out storyline are all present in this film. There's an opportunity you shouldn't pass up.\n",
      "Review 461: Every character acting without any real motives here or any solid back story on why characters are acting this way , guess this stories are reserved for second season , show tries to create an argument between moral and evil and the thin line between it but comes out as everyone is unaware and just acting as their instinct and all the season is built on small incident of *spoiler* murder and fabrication of proofs to satisfy the instinct which sounds unsatisfying as the motive behind the whole charade of killings , shows hunger for second season makes this show unfavorable after the end , dont fall for high ratings youre not missing anything .\n",
      "Review 462: It is an absolute piece of perfection. What a phenomenal series and superb acting. The cast is also very good. The amount of efforts, they have put is highly commendable. It is a must watch series. Anyone who watches will definitely love it. I suggest all my friends and relatives to watch it.\n",
      "Review 463: This is just a waste of time. A simple small story of a psycho path serial killer and this story is stretched. Can't say much - just ignore this TV Series.3 stars for good acting done by the cast or else this Tv Series is not worth your time.\n",
      "Review 464: Because of its superb cast, storyline, structure, graphics, soundtrack, and plot, the production is fantastic. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra have all been exceptional. This show will almost certainly win the prise. A programme like this may cause you to reconsider your assumptions. This series has gone to great lengths to blend mythology with technology. I cannot suggest it highly enough; read it. A mind-blowing suspense tale that will keep you wondering till the very end. The trailer does not do the film credit. The film has it all: mythology, psychology, forensics, excellent music, and a well-planned plot. You should not pass up this opportunity.\n",
      "Review 465: Poor execution, bad acting, feeding superfluous dialogues to actors, mismanaged scenes. The list goes on. There are many holes in the plot. After some time you get bored of even pointing out the mistakes in the plot.\n",
      "Review 466: This web series definitely required a significant amount of time and work to make. The story is intriguing on multiple levels. The rich character representations and constant quality of the plot between episodes demonstrate the series' storytelling ability. The series' depiction of the devastation caused by modern conflict serves as a gloomy reminder of the magnitude of those repercussions. In the film business, more precisely constructed web series like this are required. As a result, I beg the show's makers to create Season 3 as soon as possible. The screenplay is excellent, and Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance as the protagonist takes the production to new heights.\n",
      "Review 467: I mean what is this according to this show all the Vedas,all the upnisad and the geeta is giving wrong direction to the one who completely studied itNo one has right to put Hinduism in wrong mannerReally now tv shows are just using religion especially Hinduism to make anything they want\n",
      "Review 468: The absence of profanity and harsh language distinguishes this series from others. If you want, include everyone in the family. Set aside seven or eight hours to watch the full series. Finally, the cinematography and acting are also excellent. There isn't a single flaw in the entire series. Asur's popularity is well-deserved. There isn't a single weak spot. I'm presently suffering from an Asur hangover. The soundtrack in the beginning and conclusion is really foreboding. My mind keeps reliving it. To be honest, that was one of the finest concerts I'veever seen. Every part of the picture was enjoyable to me, from the screenplay to the direction to the performances. I read the entire book of Asur in one sitting. I'd never seen a whole Web series in one sitting before today. Finally, a brilliant programme capable of competing with the West. Please accept my heartfelt thanks for putting up such an outstanding show.\n",
      "Review 469: The second season of Asur is a masterpiece in suspense. Although all of the performers are superb, Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti provide particularly strong performances. The plot is exciting and fast-paced, keeping the reader wondering until the very end. The presentation masterfully combines scientific truth and ancient folklore. The author's use of the Vedas and other ancient writings to provide light on the serial killer's psyche is both interesting and disturbing. The series also investigates the possibility of AI being utilised for evil. The series' virtues and shortcomings are examined in detail below. *Excellent acting* *A tight, thrilling, and thought-provoking plot* *combines folklore and current technologies. Weaknesses include: *poor visual effects (VFX) and a few plot holes.\n",
      "Review 470: More tends towards mythology including babas and stuff. Thrill is present but at some point becomes flat and boring.I found it scary. I should understand after watching trailer.But 2 stars for background theme i really liked a lot even kept it as my ringtone.Content is different from normal indian series but i insist you should skip this.\n",
      "Review 471: People showering the paise of the show don't actually know the meaning of TV-series. For them TV show is just Gandi-Baat, Four More Shots Please and likes. They are unaware of the their contemporaries viz. True Detective, Mindhunter, Manhunt Abomber etc. That being said, lets move to the plot.The plot is non-sensical. Acting is very dull. Big disappointment. Flawed narration and a lot of factual errors in the myths pelted in the name of Hindu mythology. Over-exaggerated dialogues with no relation to plot, often seems like typical Middle-Aged-Indian-Movie.When talked of Plot, let's see the agenda too. The show is rabid Hindup**bic. A lot of fake narration in in the name of Hinduism. Hindus are, as usual, presented as bigots who have learned a lot of scriptures and hence they've become intolerant.In short, save your time. Abstain yourself from watching this. Go watch by the likes of True-Detectives instead. And please save yourself from watching any Indian TV series, they're disgrace in the name of series.\n",
      "Review 472: Lot of goofs in it. One of the First episode scene when arshad is checking the car he is wearing gloves and when car combusts he is not wearing it. What the hell! Is director sleepy or whatü§£ü§£ü§£\n",
      "Review 473: Its a must watch, good to see arshad warsi in such roles..story.. screenplay..music everything is so beautiful it connects you from the first episode...Rest all the Actors have done a wonderful jobSharib hashmi, vishesh bansal, amey wagh n all. Great job.\n",
      "Review 474: It's the best Indian Web series you will ever watch because of its mixture of Crime & Indian Mythology.The acting, story, visuals, the damn music, everything is just epic! üî•\n",
      "Review 475: Asur is a daring thriller which stands out for its creative writing and great performances. It takes viewers on a thrilling journey of the world of mythology, forensic science and a battle between a cop and a man who believes that he is a reincarnation of asur. A superb cast led by Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti includes phenomenal performances by Ameya Wagh, Sharib Hashmi and Gaurav Arora. This series has engaging narrative of fusion of mythology, crime and technology with shocking twists. The writing is intelligent and entertaining at the same time, keeping the audience's interest across every episode. Asur is a must watch that will leave you captivated and wanting more.\n",
      "Review 476: I am not here to compare any TV series but just to let you know that we have not such amazing integration of Mythology and modern forensic ever in India.it is really beyond my understanding that why few people have given such low rating to this series. Every series has flaws but this is worth watching.Most of us watch the series based on their rating, including me. This series does not deserve anything less than 9 stars.This series is an amazing try by indian series makers.We should love it and appreciate it.All of the characters were performed brilliantly. Story telling is superb and it will keep you on edge. Mythology part is amazing.It really pains to see the rating goes below than other not so good tv series. If we want good series in future we should start appreciating the good ones we have now. and this is definitely the one we can start with.\n",
      "Review 477: The first part of the series was good but the creators have yet again found a way to malign sanatan dharm. Trying to potray sanatan as a fear and terror mongering religion when in reality it has no substance at all. The makers of the show have basically laughed at all your faces and yall are appreciating it. That is the only problem with sanatan dharm. It should not be compared with any other terrorist film which have a ton of real life examples to go with. It is the start of a new era of derogatory genre which will in future try to badmouth sanatan in the same way. The teachings depicted are in no way connected to sanatan.\n",
      "Review 478: Before anything, I think this show is definitely a must watch for thrill seekers and those looking for something fresh.Asur's ability to tie together mythology, psychology, digging deeper into criminal psychology and the right and wrongs of a crime are incredible indeed. Full marks for that. Further, the plot is clever and fast paced and at the same time gives due regard to developing the facets of some key characters.However my issue is what appears to be redundancies in the way the story develops ahead (at least in some parts) - and seems out of character. I don't want to talk more on this as that would border on spoilers.In any case its easily worth a watch and thrill seeker/mystery aficionados will certainly enjoy it. Great effort on part of the team behind it. Hope to see more from them. Cheers.\n",
      "Review 479: Entertaining, gripping series. Actors are perfect. Their acting skills are unmatchable. Give your time for this series. Waiting for season 2.\n",
      "Review 480: Not a dull moment in the whole series. Way above seven and zodiac...... It will remain in my mind for a very long time. What a matter piece\n",
      "Review 481: A Thrilling and suspenseful series, some of content like scared games music like GOT but the story is fresh with a good actingZero percent boring it's a engaging story must watch\n",
      "Review 482: I paid 500 just for this series. It is more than a movie ticket in india. But the series is totally worth the money. It is a thriller and for a thriller it needs to be suspenseful. And hell yeah it succeeded in that. Until the last episode i was confused about the main antagonists. It also questions your moral values. I could understand why the characters did what they did even though it was morally wrong. This series is the best series to come out of india. Watch it. This series deserves respect.\n",
      "Review 483: ASUR is a great compilation of Forensics, Suspense and Mythology where it is shown how mythological beliefs are manipulated by people for their benefits.It is an interesting story for a hunt of serial killer who is on a killing spree and whose beliefs about our culture and mythology are somewhat different.Do they catch the serial killer, who is he, how is he connected, what are his thoughts???\n",
      "Review 484: Arshad Warsi is again with Asur for the audience and his fans this time on digital screen. Superb movie with superb writing and direction. All actors' action timing is top notch.\n",
      "Review 485: With an Realistic Direction and Maintaining perfect Balance Between Forensic and Mythology team Asur successfully Represent A Unique Crime Thriller For any Audience who are Interested in watching A Unique and Masterpiece contents..\n",
      "Review 486: Season 2 is way beyond what I had imagined from it...i recommend this webseries to everyone.Story..... acting everything was 10/10 but the main hero was its dialogue n storytelling....Asur 2 was way ahead of its time and it scares you if you think of its applicability to the real world, that thought in itself is fearing.....Arshad Warsi , Barun and everyone was Bang on and special mention to characters played by shubh , kesar n rasool they all were just amazing and their dialogues made their characters even more taller....best webseries by Indian movie industry... technology mythological aspects were well connected n there blend created magic.\n",
      "Review 487: The Web series not allow you to get up from you seat. It is really fantastic picturization and each and every actor has played his role perfectly.\n",
      "Review 488: Asur is a great show imo because of the following factors1- Great cast2- Great script3- Clear understanding of indian mythology4- Crisp and clear editing work5- Arshad warsi as the leadBut where it fells short is that i think asur didn't have a lot of budget so the show doesn't have big shots or the more dramatic stuff that netflix and amazon prime shows have.I would 100% Like to see the second season of Asur and thanks voot for casting arshad varsi, he is a fantastic actor but doesn't get many opportunities.\n",
      "Review 489: We need the next season ASAP ! So intense , raw , gripping . It was a treat watching Arshad coz he's a lovely actor his performance was really good .\n",
      "Review 490: It only has suspense at the end of every epispde which makes you binge watch the show but when the show is finished, it makes you realise that you have wasted 10 precious hours of your life. I regret this decision of mine. The only good thing about this show is that the background music reminds you of money heist.\n",
      "Review 491: I love a good storyline with perfect characteristics and this series is my choice ..very nicely it executed story of two era .. darkness of a human. Name is perfectly fits to the story ASUR..all actors are superb.. I watched it twice and enjoyed a lot.\n",
      "Review 492: This Web Series Did Very Good Performance. Specially Arshad Warsi & Barun Sobti.Season 2: This is Excellent Performance. Specially Arshad Warsi & Barun Sobti and Anupriya Goenka and Riddhi Dogra and Vishesh Bansal and Pawan Chopra and Meiyang Chang and Gaurav Arora and Amey Wagh Did Outstanding Acting.\n",
      "Review 493: I liked the amount of actual Hindi words used in this HINDI series(generally we listen 90% URDU/ARABIC/FARSI/English words.)2) ep 2 @3:40*- they show LED street light in 12 years ago scene.3) when the father of the kid falls in the water, they show directly the crimination rather than taking the father to a hospital.4) I'm never been a fan of computer hacking scenes; They do basically everything without the use of Mouse.\n",
      "Review 494: Definitely something that'll keep you gripped to the screen and make you wanna watch it all at once! The suspense and thrill are definitely worth every second of your watch. A very new concept on which the series is made! Refreshing!\n",
      "Review 495: Intial 2-3 episodes were good .watched it for Arsad Warsi . Decent show , not much logic and brain needed after 3 episodes . Thought it will be nicely written like Breathe and other indian shows. Dont know why rating is 9+ . It can be somewhere between 6-7 .defiy not a 7+ series .\n",
      "Review 496: Asura, divine, in Hindu mythology, class of beings defined by their opposition to the devas or suras (gods). Every individual is a combination of both SURA & ASUR, the bright & the dark.......I think that it tries to portray. But that's not all. Episode after episode it reveals so many hidden aspects and one has to concentrate hard to find what's exactly going on. You couldn't miss a single moment as you might not be able to understand, and it doesn't allow you to do so. It is that engaging & gripping. All credit goes to the makers, the actors & ofcourse the background scores. But yes it has some flaws too which I wish is not there. Like it lacks pace, few sloppy performances, few 'Dark Knight' inspired scenes with much lesser pace and not that gripping climax. But the detailing, science & mythological plots incorporated in it makes it \"worth-a-watch.\"\n",
      "Review 497: What an amazing experience it was. The way they unfolded the mystery is quite amazing and the way they use some professional words and the chemical elements shows that they have did good research about it. The cast is also amazing especially Barun sobti has surprised me with his performance again after his tv appearance way back. A must watch\n",
      "Review 498: After watching the programme, I can confidently state that it is fantastic and rates among the best in the world. The movie should be presented to people all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, both the inventor and the author, deserve recognition for their great effort. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. A series of thrilling adventures. Every waking minute, you can'thelp but wonder about the future. Psycho, the protagonist, was depicted realistically. I knew I had to read this series the moment I saw it. Amazing work, with a concept that is both entertaining and perplexing enough to warrant a web series. I've been telling everyone I know about this internet series.\n",
      "Review 499: Is it because we're growing more isolated and lonely in this high-tech, scientific world that we're more vulnerable to scam artists who put up a decent face but truly want your power and thoughts? Interspersing a few action sequences with tense, unsettling pauses creates an unusual mood. An action film in which the protagonist spends the most of the time on screen investigating terrible crimes in exotic settings with magnificent scenery. Excellent strategy, properly carried out. For fans of the genre, this is a definite must-see. I can confidently characterise this programme now that I've seen the entire season. PHENOMENAL IN EVERY WAY OUTSTANDING.\n",
      "Review 500: It cannot get any more engrossingly intriguing then this. 10 star is less.\n",
      "Review 501: Brilliantly written & Very well executed ! A must watch for Thriller lovers !After watching the complete season, I would like to describe this show with a few adjectives. SPELLBINDING INTRIGUING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWINGHaving watched the show, I can say with a fair degree of confidence that this show is top-notch & world-class. It must be shown to the world and should not be restricted to Indian audiences only. Great work by the creator Gaurav Shukla & writers Gaurav Shukla Niren H Bhatt & Vinay Chhawal\n",
      "Review 502: 9.2 Rating for this baffles me. I found it below average and sort of absurd. Utterly predictable and unintelligent, especially the end. Waste of time for me.\n",
      "Review 503: The series has too many loose ends, from ignorance of police men killings to recruitment of unknown in CBI. Also the series deals with CBI which is the top notch department for critical cases in India, but series portrays incompetency of the department in many ways. Surely entertaining but has loose ends.\n",
      "Review 504: Asur is a brilliant piece of work. Everything works. The premise of the series is what intrigued me. The series is engaging.Few flaws, but can be ignored.BTW, I dint found the killer/villain to be surprising(I had the instinct all along the series).Don't ignore this just because it came on Voot (It should be at least on Top 10 Indian series of all time)\n",
      "Review 505: Very low production not pleasing to watch by today's standard , bad casting , very poor acting even by good actors meaning bad direction, full of cliches and sterotypes. And feels even more pathetic to me as i watched it after paatal lok. Give it a skip\n",
      "Review 506: This web series justifies its title by supporting some hard hitting mythology but you will find many flaws in the plot as the story progresses. The killer invites Nikhil Nair from USA after he commits series of murders with extraordinary planning and yet he needs Nikhil's planning for future killings. The part where they murder a businessman in just few seconds with the help of power cut is utter senseless. Gaurav Arora as kesar bhardwaj is impressive. Arshad warsi was a misfit despite his good acting. They could have made it exceptional but ruined somehow\n",
      "Review 507: Its a full stuff entertainment web series including a very good msj for KARMA and Kaliyug.Don't miss it. Perfect stuff nowadays, in holidays of corona shutdown situation, to watch at home.\n",
      "Review 508: Story starts with the mythological angel and it's executed very well and the connection between all characters are really good. Excitement increased with the all episodes to know what will happen next... shows a dark side of a personality ..I really enjoyed all episodes for me it's complete package.\n",
      "Review 509: I have seen such thriller with ample amount of suspense after a long time. It is perfect Series for the Lock down period. The series will get out of the world.\n",
      "Review 510: I rally like the Web Series so much, We can't go out of the Home to watch the Movies. This is really a superb Series to kill the Boriyat\n",
      "Review 511: Mythology based serial killings. The concept was good by the execution and acting was below average\n",
      "Review 512: This is the worst hindi series I have watched till date. Story is full of loopholes. Worst acting, bad writing and poor execution. Bored to death. I just wanted it to end, I wish I would have stopped watching earlier.\n",
      "Review 513: Though the premise of blended Indian mythology with forensic criminology is good,the story is pathetically handled with gaping loopholes in the plot.The police and the CBI are shown mere puppets. That's surely not the way, the diligent cops of our nation handle such cases.No CCTV footages,no trackers,no witness,no evidence and some deranged fanatics are killing innocent ones anytime at their whims and perverse ideologies. There is a dark side in all of us is the pretext. A cop nabs a psychopath and that's his dark side! Really?!!Terribly bad piece of closure with a violent death of logic and reason.Fully disappointed.\n",
      "Review 514: A handful of action between fear of life and death set pieces set an exotic excitement amongst viewers. Action is a series of seen it together with the hero taking centre stage and doing searches with bodies in some exotic locations and the sets are amazing it creates excitement till the end and its overall amazing.\n",
      "Review 515: This series is actually mind boggling. Anyone who is thriller lover,love to watch every frame of this series. It should be on the top of Indian web series.\n",
      "Review 516: Brilliant concept of Hindu Mythology being brought to life through beliefs and delusions. Definitely will be waiting for Season 2.\n",
      "Review 517: #asur might b confuse with name but it means evil.. a new series on #voot . As a name of the series it means how asur comes which is inside man or human. How priorties changes one for another. How ur inside asur comes ups to save ur own .Ur thought might be right for one and wrong for other.A very well dark story scripted . 8 episode with every episode make u fall deeper and deeper inside the story. Dialogue to directions and the acting is speechless.Hardwork of entire team is amazing.Must and must watch .\n",
      "Review 518: Well this was a mind-blowing suspense thriller. The script keeps you engaged through out the movie. One thing which I literally loved is that Background music, boy was just amazing, Bickram Ghosh has done an excellent job! The last seen with that BGM gave goosebumps really.\n",
      "Review 519: This online series is so professionally crafted that it quickly draws viewers into its intricate plot. The remarkable storyline is showcased by the consistent quality of each episode and the depth of the characters. The show's depiction of the devastating impacts of modern warfare serves as a sobering reminder of such ramifications. More shows of this type should be made on the internet by the film business. Therefore, I humbly request that work begin on Season 3 of this show as soon as possible. Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance as the series' protagonist helps make the show stand out, and the writing and acting in it are also excellent.\n",
      "Review 520: This series became attractive to me at the first sight of it. It is absolutely mindblowing and the plot of the story is also interesting and confusing at the same time which makes the web series even more interesting. I always recommend my friends to watch this absolutely incredible web series and I also myself love watching it too.\n",
      "Review 521: I mean it. Watched the entire season only due to the lockdown. Very thin storyline with several disjointed events and relations. Nothing comes together in the narrative, and you are left wondering how a show like this got such high ratings. It's just a random collection of events and people whose only purpose seems to do ever more unlikely and believable things. Nothing is ever connected or explained. The only saving grace is the sense of tension that runs through much of the show.\n",
      "Review 522: A mutch watch series .Gripping tale.An underrated movie.This is a good story after a very long time.\n",
      "Review 523: Asur 2 makes one feel as if CBI is full of fools. One silly blunder after another. Every CBI official trying to undo another officer's good work. It shows that he CBI hires crazy people and are not at all trained to understand basic human mind. It shows how each individual is working on his or her own and nobody else knows what that individual is doing.The writer has beautifully adopted the art of streching. At one instance it shows that the entire team of cbi is being replaced as there seems to be some inside leak and then it shows the same officials working with an addition of 2 more useless characters in the team. Funny.\n",
      "Review 524: The most most thrilling web series...just speechless... eagerly waiting for season 2.\n",
      "Review 525: This web series is one of my favourite and it's story is full of suspense. Brilliant acting by all actors specially Arshad warsi and Barun sobti. Must watch mvie.\n",
      "Review 526: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing someone. Asur is superb in every regard, particularly its writing, which had me wondering till the very end. I've finished watching Asur and have seen every episode. The taste is outstanding. Slow in places, but worth watching for the deeper look into Indian mythology and story it provides. As a result, I didn't find it too bothersome. After a long absence, I finally saw an urdu thriller, and it was well worth the wait. Arshad Warsi joins Asur in front of the cameras and his admirers on the digital screen this time. Outstanding story and directing, both of which are brilliantly portrayed. The actors are all flawlessly in harmony with one another. Everyone in attendance did their utmost to make it a night to remember. Thank you very much to Gaurav Shukla, who wrote this beautifully. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team should be commended as well. The following job is currently pending.\n",
      "Review 527: Cons:Concept -- Lifted from The Dark Knight and gave it an Indian touch---Production values -- Little better than CID show on sony channel.----Background score -- After a point its irritating---Plot -- You can see that coming from a mile--Pros:Arshad Warsi and Barun sobti's performance--Animation used in story telling\n",
      "Review 528: One of the best Bollywood flicks I've ever seen. One of my favourite SOBTI BARUN It's the greatest Arshad Warsi has ever done, and I can't wait for season two. This is the finest online series I've watched in a long time, and it has piqued my interest in more Bollywood stuff. I often prefer American TV, but this has piqued my interest in seeing what Bollywood has to offer. Please watch it because it is a piece of art; I'm tempted to give you a spoiler, but I won't. This play is more than just a thrilling read. It's a mental teasing game. The narrative deepens and culminates near the series' midway, leaving you wanting more. The term \"psychological thriller\" captures this episode well.\n",
      "Review 529: Still on ASUR Hangover. The Director was Genius, He doesn't want to end it on A Right Cliffhanger because they've become so routine? \"I am Omnipresent, I will see you soon\"\n",
      "Review 530: ASUR on Voot is SPECTACULAR. One of the Finest Writings Ever. A Game-changer in Indian Series & Masterpiece in Crime-Thriller Genre. The Mix of Puranas-Itihasas to Cold-blooded Murders is What takes it THIS SERIES DESERVES ALL THE HYPE\n",
      "Review 531: The most attracting highlight of the character Moksh in the series is his flawless hindi vocabulary and actor Aditya Lal has delivered those dialogues seamlessly and effortlessly. From Bhagvad Gita's excerpts to Sanksrit's Shlokas, We just couldn't take our eyes and ears away when the actor speaks\n",
      "Review 532: I have just finished The astounding Web series ASUR.. An another masterpiece of Arshad Warsi and the Man \"Shubh\" and the way of his addressing the Indian mythology has made me big fan of him also\n",
      "Review 533: In the moment where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a character, there is an editing issue. Everything in Asur is fantastic, particularly the writing, which had me guessing and intrigued till the very end. I've seen every episode of Asur. It's very excellent. It moves slowly at times, but this helps you to better understand the plot and Indian mythology. So I didn't mind it. After a long time, I saw an urdu thriller that captivated me to the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears on a digital screen alongside Asur for the benefit of the crowd and his followers. Excellent script and execution in this flick. All of the performers have perfect action synchronisation. Everyone involved worked hard to make it memorable. Special thanks to Gaurav Shukla for the outstanding writing he created. Also, congratulations to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire crew for their outstanding work. I'm now waiting for my next task.\n",
      "Review 534: Best in India... Even better than the family man.... Arshaad and barun killed it. Again best web series in India.\n",
      "Review 535: Or the artists (composers, directors, and actors). This is well worth your time. I'm hoping for a season two. I can confidently characterise this programme now that I'veseen the entire season. The concert was fantastic; after watching it, I was sure in declaring it was one of the best in the world. The movie should be presented to people all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, both the inventor and the author, deserve recognition for their great effort. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh provided outstanding performances in this piece by Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal, which was expertly directed by Oni Sen. Season 2 has my full focus.\n",
      "Review 536: Brilliant series !!! Arshad and barun did a comendable job.. better than kjo's movies.\n",
      "Review 537: Yes, Arshad Warsi, you are entirely correct. The notion is excellent, and it is handled admirably. The entire cast did an excellent job of portraying their roles. Asur, the greatest Hindi online series, skilfully combines Hindu spiritual themes with scientific notions. I was fully absorbed, and I can't wait to read the next chapter. Asur will get every prise handed out this year. A web series with outstanding acting, direction, and plot receives a perfect score of 10/10. What I just accomplished is incomprehensible to me. I'll give it a shot during the weekend when all of the episodes are out (conveniently, they taped over the weekend). Still reeling from the surprise... Explain Kali's identify to me. To what extent does this persist? The finest fiction keeps readers guessing until the very last page. Let us hope that the manufacturing and publication steps do not take too long.\n",
      "Review 538: In my view, one of the best Bollywood films ever created. I've been waiting for a web series like this, and it hasn't disappointed, thanks to an incredible performance by one of my favourite actors, Arshad Warsi. I can't wait to see more Bollywood films and programmes. My curiosity in Bollywood has been sparked; I usually watch American TV. I'm tempted to give away a spoiler, but I'll refrain since it's art and you should see it. This is much more than a thrilling read. This is a mental stimulation activity. The narrative thickens and you hit your peak of interest around the midway point of the series. This show may be classified as a \"psychological thriller\" since that is exactly what it is.\n",
      "Review 539: I was never in the history of Indian television or world ,this kind of content is created which is combination of mythology and technology is involved.Starting from first season and and the end of second season it's kept holding the nerves of viewer.Watch it to understand the dilemma and how people struggle to make decisions when they face dilemma.This worth watching, it's content are really great, who is write ‚úç üëå really really great.Writer is really need 10 out of ten for this. Far better than to watch this compare to watch nonsense thing available online. It will we worth watching. Thanks.\n",
      "Review 540: Everyone who contributed did their best to make it exceptional. We owe Gaurav Shukla a debt of gratitude for his well-written article. Thanks are also extended to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the incredible team. In anticipation of the next assignment. The concept is beautiful. After what seemed like an eternity, I was delighted to see Arsad Warsi on film again. It is astonishing how the concept of two universes battling evil can function. The film's description piqued my interest before I even saw the trailer. Asur is more than just another criminal drama in which forensics experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobsi pursue a serial killer. It compels us to evaluate the principles by which we live and the choices we make under the most challenging conditions.\n",
      "Review 541: The concept, story line and background music was really good but overall it lacks logic and too many loop holes.And not so convincing acting specially from Arshad Warsi. Nikhil ,Nusrat did a decent job.And specially the villain didn't really suitable for the role. Overall an one time watch for sure!\n",
      "Review 542: Lead actor failed to perform o have watched many web series this one good too but Barun failed to deliver he can't act ....\n",
      "Review 543: Its a perfect series which is very realistic and mythologically true in every episode. Every scene has a significant contribution to the whole masterpiece. I am surprised why is not launched in a high scale like sacred games or any other series.Definitely better than Sacred Games or Mirzapur.Hats off to the writer Gaurav Shukla and director Oni Sen.Lastly the gem or what can I say pearl of the series Arshad Warsi and the villian along with the entire cast portrait their character brilliant.I still cant get over the story line and background music.\n",
      "Review 544: After watching a lot of detective thriller this story seems to me, missing a lot of points. Good to watch but as usual like some comedy movie you can bring the pieces together. You will like if you are new to this genre. Otherwise its just waste of time!!Although need to give full credit to all actor, actress & staff for their hard work. Just story is not strong enough.\n",
      "Review 545: Started with lots of promise, the plot was great..but at the end lots of questions unanswered, gaps in the story, simple things missed out!! Waste of my time!!!\n",
      "Review 546: ASUR is probably the best web series in India right now. I've never seen such beautiful blend of science and mythology in a Web series. This show is definitely better than the extremely overhyped Mirzapur and Sacred games.Some people have a habit of bashing anything that is being widely appreciated, don't read those 1 star reviews and avoid spoilers on social media.Happy watching!\n",
      "Review 547: Just they are making viewers fool by showing 9.3 IMDB rating in there promo pic.I have seen whole series and its full on believe me.How everything is happening nothing has been shown\n",
      "Review 548: This series is worth every minute until 7th episode but the last one will awaken Asur inside you to see this disappointing end result. Lot of loopholes but can be overseen due to tight script and perfect editing but then you realise after watching the climax that you have indeed been cheated. Technically very impressive but apparently the opportunity to create a masterpiece was unfortunately wasted. Skip this and instead watch Special Ops.\n",
      "Review 549: This is mind blowing suspense thriller which keeps you guessing all the time. It's trailer does not do justice.Mythology, psychology, forensics, great background music and genius story /screenplay. Don't miss it.\n",

      "Review 555: There are lot of instances where we see the soft side of the negative character Moksh... And Actor Aditya Lal has portrayed that feeling very well in the series.. As the series conclude that heroes also have a grey side, villains also have soft spot and can be nice too\n",
      "Review 556: The scenes of Barun and Aditya together are worth the watch and intense. It shows lot of emotions of both characters and they look great on screen together. The Duo as a team, literally worked well in the series... No spoilers here...\n",
      "Review 557: Binged watched asur on Voot Select Brilliantly written and executed web series...One of the best hindi web series..Too good\n",
      "Review 558: Thank you Oni Sen and Gaurav for giving us Asur,a masterpiece webseries. I bet India has never seen any series like this.The concept is just love Arshad Warsi sir you won our heart in your web series debut. Hope to see the twisted season 2 soon,with another 'Perfect Crime' situation!\n",
      "Review 559: Below par series, below par acting, very unconvincing.\n",
      "Review 560: Arshad And barun has given their pawer pack performance. Such mind blowing suspense thriller which keeps you guessing all the time. Waiting for the season 2\n",
      "Review 561: After hearing a lot of praise for the show \"Asur\" a web series finally thought of giving it a watch. Asur is a good show but you can feel the direction getting off the track and illogical aimed to wrap up the series and they messed up the end so bad felt like the last two episodes were directed by someone else. It has many loopholes and flaws in it but comparing it to other Indian series it's a good one but not an exceptional one(Not even close). I can't stop talking about the flaws in it. I might give you the spoilers. Sloppy acting overrated and boring. It should have completed in episode 4 or 5. Even the lead actors looked disinterested after some point. You will be craving for it to end but it keeps dragging. I'm keen on thrillers so, in this sort of genre, the series like True Detective and The Mentalist kinda set my standards way too high that's why Asur was hard for me to digest. Those who call it a perfect work of art clearly have not watched the above series.\n",
      "Review 562: Its best web series and so realistic picturization.I really like Nikhil's character . thinking of murderer and how forensic team chase him is very well executed. its best time pass series.every actor justified his character. journey of both era is superb.\n",
      "Review 563: What a season it was...Watching it over and over again to visit the details. It has been put magnificently. All the actors have been stunning in their performance. It is a completely gripping story and you simply cannot put it aside without finishing once you start.\n",
      "Review 564: This series is insane...Thanks to jio cinema for giving us this free watching .. Storytelling is so captivating and it makes you sit there for more blasting moments of this season. Barun sobti as Nikhil Nair played very well that his character transformation is commendable. Arshad warsi also justified his character very well. I felt Nusrat lost her charecter value little in this second season and Naina captured it in this season. And Subh Joshi what a character it is . He is the hero and villain of the series. He Well played with the game and the rest team also chased his game very well..Nice.\n",
      "Review 565: Home guards possess more intellect than the highly decorated CBI people as shown in the series which doesn't make sense where there is an underlying social message which is completely lost among the numerous bloopers. If they actually act like this, the bureau must be shut down.P.S. Shall definitely skip the next season and shall try to influence all around me not to watch it.\n",
      "Review 566: Extraordinary: This series is one of the best indian thriller kind of series, everything is shaded by story and screen play. It's not like every chor-police series we are watching everytime.Acting is good, direction is better, story is best and screen play is superb.\n",
      "Review 567: Perfect End from the entertainment prospective i can say that this is not a karan johar pictrure or video in which at the end villan must die or would get 100% defeat.\n",
      "Review 568: Like the show, all things are better. like banarasi or Saharanpur type accents. Character detailing was powerful. No patchy scenes. In days when ppl r making great shows Asur show 100% perfection in every scene, Hoping for more better season 2.\n",
      "Review 569: A must watch thriller for every thriller lover. After many days, lovely to watch Arshad Warsi on screen. He is fantastic.\n",
      "Review 570: The story is really so good that I cannot even describe it through my words and the actions and thrillers in this series really gives me chills like I have never seen such a cool series before and my favourite Arshad Warsi is also there yass.\n",
      "Review 571: Till 7th episode the series was gripping. Everything including the title track seems to be a copy of sacred games. After the 7th episode the writers mind went for a toss and they wrote some implausible twists and turns. Seems like the main villain is some kind of Marvel superhero and can do absolutely anything. Only good thing in the show is the mature acting by Arshad Warsi.If you want to waste your time you can go for it.\n",
      "Review 572: One of the worst season ever watched, story line is too good but poorest acting by all the actors. Their are many other season inline which can be watched.No sense on using technology, it feels like watching a windows - 98 version of techie.please avoid wasting time on this\n",
      "Review 573: One of the finest series which will not allow you to miss a single episode.It's a crime thriller show full of original content, completely rooted in our culture as well as contemporary issues.\n",
      "Review 574: Moksh played a very powerful character in the Asur. In the entire series, his eyes have done more talking and what not (for many girl fans). The actor talks through his eyes.. The expression and that killer eye roll in the most badass style has wooed so many. I am amazed with Moksh aka Aditya lal acting\n",
      "Review 575: One of the reviewer wrote that what you can expect on app like voot where shows like roadies and Splitsvilla there and the people who rated this high only watch roadies and Splitsvilla kind of shows.Let me tell you my friend i don't watch those shoes and I also say that it's not worth 10 rating. But its a good attempt from Indian series perspective. We should be thankful that people have started making such shows in India. It's definitely not 10 but it's a very very good attempt and we should appreciate that also it's definitely not crap.\n",
      "Review 576: I know this has lot of loop holes and certain characters are simply inserted and story is strong but some scenes are annoying and can be trimmed but acting is thing I liked the most in this series. Finally good multilayered dark thriller series.\n",
      "Review 577: A good show destroyed by pathetic acting of lead actor barun sobti. Terrible dialogue delivery, funny & hilarious expressions, amateurish mannerisms. What he mumbles in his squeakish voice, you cant decipher even after repeated attempts. Other actors, including warsi are also not fully utilized. But sadly barun sobti single handedly took away the soul of the show.\n",
      "Review 578: A unique crime thriller that pits two opposing worlds against each other. The less explored, intricate world of forensic science and the deep mysticism of ancient Indian Mythology.Asur is a drama web-series which has to be watched.\n",
      "Review 579: As per Indian web series is masterpiece with great story also the Indian god and devil'sIt tell message that \" every person has one devil üòà \" is proved in very secen..........\n",
      "Review 580: Wht a story line...first of its kindand never seen before ....loved this plot ...waiting for season 2\n",
      "Review 581: Good story with interesting but average execution with the help of mythology.\n",
      "Review 582: I loved this show. This was full of psychopath character. Loved the twist in the show, the internal team had a hole himself. Arshan Warsi and Barun Sobti's acting were incredible. Overall the story was amazing , its a 10/10 show. The last episode had so much adrenal rush. There were twists at every stage, why nair was getting coordinates. Why Shubh killed his father, why killing so many people. Why themselves were helping people?I loved this show. This was full of psychopath character.

      "Review 583: After great first season....they took all these years for this storyline ???story was not gripping...few episodes were unnecessarily put into the series ....the way investigation agency are shown like fools in the series is astonishing...in first season you get angry on this villain...but in second one ...you feel pity for them...CBI don't even crosscheck guys background before taking him in team..and just by visiting his home after 5 years they understand that this guy is using someone else identity.....retired raw personal easily getting into ATF...IT professional having easy access to CBI systems.... CBI giving away important data for saving NUSRATs life knowing that it can lead to death of millions of people....everything is so convenient ....Watch BATMAN - Dark knight rises...instead...story is no different....\n",
      "Review 584: Arshad in another avatar... Totally brilliant..Best web series i ever watched.\n",
      "Review 585: U cant denied watching 1 episode later on u moved with next 5 episode superb show. It is about future killing and murder how take place. I bet u, even u don't like the suspense after this u ll believe there is something good in it.\n",
      "Review 586: Suspense at its next level. Arshad Varsi generally opts comic roles, but in Asur he has given his 100% in playing the role of cop. Fantastic, Superb, Awesome. Amey Wagh also played a good cameo. Words are insufficient to praise the series. You must watch it once.\n",
      "Review 587: Asur part 1 was thrilling, full of suspense and have some nice performances but part 2 is perfect sequel to this kind of series. The story derives references from mythology and fits it perfectly in the present time with a mastermind antagonist played by Abhishek Chauhaan of Cubicle fame and Vishesh Bansal (as teenage).Entire ensemble is up to the mark Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti,Nidhi Dogra,Anupriya Goenka, child artist Atharva as Anant ,etc they all played their part well and keep the audience glued to their seats.We need more such well researched,written,performed and directed series in our country.\n",
      "Review 588: Asur is an excellent scientific thriller with mythology. Technically it is well-above any other Indian thriller. Would advise everyone to watch this web series as it sets a new wave of intelligent Indian thrillers. However, as a author of several gripping thrillers, I found two inconsistencies:1. Two police officials were killed, yet no investigation who or why they killed.2. When Rasool Sheikh went on raid with with Lorak Dubey, other police staff knew they were together. Yet after killing Lorak Dubey, Rasool Sheikh was not interrogated. This is major point which the thriller evaded.I would have given it a 9 rating, had these two issues being maturely handled.Don't get discouraged for my being critical. Go and see it. You would love it.\n",
      "Review 589: Each and every episode hold you and watching more again and again. Suspense, thrilled too worthy. Impressive and good content to watch in this series. I'm waiting second season.\n",
      "Review 590: Just watch asur what a masterpece and stroy well written and satifacted at end the series show the dark side of people and everthing . The stroy is well connected to indain mythlogy the language is also best i like the hindi lests talk about acting one of best actor i saw in thgis series everyone palyed their role tooo impressive no doubt i nvere imagine i will senn such acting in india lets talk about some negative this series is ok but i dont like the way he kill people they kill innconet people if they dont tell exact reason to kill people the only reason i dont like this how but this is trule one of best series.\n",
      "Review 591: You get all in one package:A pinch of Saw, A bag of Deathnote style rivalry, Hindu mythology references, always underrated Arshad Warsi, good direction and casting..\n",
      "Review 592: This a best class web series with many twisted. All characters are played thier best role .\n",
      "Review 593: This show started very well but could be better if they able to keep the suspense till the end instead of spoiling in midway.People who are talking about plot holes, that exactly could not be considered as a plot holes because if any character doesn't make mistakes then how the story progress?One thing i didn't like is some characters \"just know\" what other character is planning this is just ridiculous, could be better if they gave some explanation or something instead of \"they know these things just like that\"\n",
      "Review 594: Mixture of Hannibal and Dark Knight. Last plot was exactly similar to Dark Knight\n",
      "Review 595: A very well made thriller. Interesting and gripping.\n",
      "Review 596: The series touches on the human nature. How a dad's abuse towards a son can turned out to be so damaging that the butterfly effect would cause turmoil on such a big scale.I would say the last episode was right on point. The other episode were kind of just elongating the series to make it longer. Being a tech nerd, there were way too many mistakes that were hard to avoid.\n",
      "Review 597: The way this series combines mythology and crime, is just mind blowing. Such an amazing story with this much strong acting performances and that too without any plotholes. Can't wait for its 2nd season.\n",
      "Review 598: It takes u to Ur dark side with mythological way of connecting d serial killings ..was looking for dis type of Indian series only after SG and mirzapur .. Arshad warsi acted d best of his career\n",
      "Review 599: The series is okay. The plot is also okay and predictive. The script is kinda weak.The killer who kills Arshad's wife; was he being filmed by someone else or it was he filming the murder himself? The dialogues are there just for the sake of creating tension and to move the plot forward.This series reminded me much of a show called Hannibal, but the later was very well directed; each actor played their own character persona but here, the actors are only there because the story wants them to be.\n",
      "Review 600: The story was very straight forward yet very interesting. The idea of mixing science and hindu mythology of series was rare and new. And of course the murder mysteries and suspense which was being created was also extreme. Acting from all the actors were awesome. Direction was also greate.The facets which i really found poor are ...The same music which was being played in repeatedly during the series which was annoying.After 6th episode you would find the series very slow.They were pulling the story more through unnecessary scenes.Waiting for 2nd season.......\n",
      "Review 601: Woww now thats what we call a fabulous thriller series. Started with one episode and finished it at a stretch. Superb performance by every single star cast and arshad warshi nails it. One of those series which u can watch again and again\n",
      "Review 602: The whole story was based on the boy who's a mind which learn books in minutes and wait he was a chutiya in CBI team..and there is no way that CBI told who's subh joshi..Overall khoda pahad nikla chuha..Like the max Bollywood movies..Sorry you can watch for thriller but in the end you'll regret to watch the whole series...\n",
      "Review 603: I have watched almost every indian eeb series especially Suspense thrillers...i found it even better than Sacred Games....i watched the whole series in one go...till 3 in the morning...\n",
      "Review 604: They tried to make it one in million. In some point, they might have achieved Their goal. But the story is not perfect at all, let alone perfect. It has too many plot holes that i can't even count, and acting also poor of maximum characters. otherwise it's a great indian tv series\n",
      "Review 605: Are u intrested in indian mythology.... than asur is higly recomended web series... a next level crime thriller which moves around world of forensic science , first 7 episods will blow ur mind..climex could be little betr...must watch...\n",
      "Review 606: The series is extremely well plotted with suspense and thriller throughout the season. The background music is Bang on. The twist and turns will keep you bing watching it.\n",
      "Review 607: Its kind of similar concept like Batman's the dark knight.But yet more powerful and impactful.I really had dream same night when I completed the series.I mean are we really living in selfish sociaty and World where we are only devotees to our loved ones whenever any circumstances come to save humanity.Loved the mathological storys of \" vishnupuran\". I mean in other way our God also did something wrong or non ethically to win or give to prioritise to dev then asur.Asur were never evil but our God made them so evil due to thier partiality and so many wrong decision.I must say writer done very well job by introducing us this controversial concept.\n",
      "Review 608: Ppl are unnecessarily hating this show. In the beginning, it really had good ratings but when more number of ppl started watching it to see what the hype is, the more it's ratings went down. Ppl, it ain't that serious. Sure this series has its own flaws but that's ok, not everything has to be perfect. All of these reviews here are those ppl who are trying to compare it to international suspense/thriller series. We get it, y'all saw some English shows and expect the same thing from Indian shows. Not everything has to be perfect. To be honest, not brilliant but a good attempt. So stop with the hate and just enjoy it. At least we are getting a thriller show with some good storyline. I wanted to give like a 7 rating but I wanted to support this show coz of all the unnecessary hate here so I give it a 10 rating. Expecting big things in season 2, if there is any.\n",
      "Review 609: Ive just started watching this after all these articles on media and my friends talking about how AWESOME THIS, well they're right show is for AWESOME if you hasn't watched shows like \"true detective\" \"hannibal\"This show has very good storyline, suspense is real, but hey we're indians, do we leave anything without shoving our sh\"tty bollywood family drama? No right? Same cr\"p alllover again, Our heroes are doing a life-threatening jobs FBI sorry CBI and their poor wives are living in fear, they want their husbands to spend time with family, just stop it FFS ü§£This show did a copy of many hollywood series not so obvious but they did, they copied scene from Legendary Anime Death Note. BOOOOO.\n",
      "Review 610: I couldn't believe what I just watched. It was so thrilling and full of suspense but it is also a truth of our new generation. This series Deserve to be published internationally with multiple languages. I never thought our indian cinema have gone that far. I wish it could be done by Bollywood so that more and more people will able to watch. I strongly recommend people to watch this series'. The more you watch and the more you will be surprised to see the truth of the reality. But to be honest,this movie deserve high publicity. I watch something similar series named \"the 100\" before. Now this series gave me goosebumps.\n",

Comfortably the finest Web Series to come out of India.The 2nd installment is even more riveting than the 1st one. Super hi-tech too. The ideation to execution is an absolute treat. Never for a second you will feel the use technology is unwarranted, wasted or over cooked. It looks every part the series and adds value to the intense and profound script. It would be unfair to single out an actor to praise, as the whole cast has done a stellar job and is collectivelypraiseworthy.Magnificent and that exactly is Asur 2 !!!!\n",

      "Review 628: Asur season 1 is a story of a psycopath killer and how he makes others also do murder. I loved the acting of the cast particulary Barun Sobtu and Anupriya Goenka. Vishesh Rajput the child actor also needs to be praised for his performance. Arshad Warsi was fine. I loved the soty narration andhow things unfloded in the soty. FIrst two episoeds were a little slow then things sudenly took place in the third epidose and it was fun to watch. Last two episodes were full on dhamka. I had a nice expereince watching this series. You wll reeally relate to the feelings of Barun Sobti actor in certain situations. Riddhi DOsgra as Nusraatt was also nice so was Sharib Hasmhi's charcter. I recommend you to watch this series. This is a murder mystery story. You can watch if you like this genre. This series is not boring. You will get along with the story once you start watching it. I rate Asur Season 1 8 stars on 10. 2 stars I removed because first two episodes were a little slow for me. Otherwise the story is good. I found some parts of the story littlee different like the concepts like asur and etc. Won't reveal.\n",

      "Review 635: We all have our good sides and bad sides. They depend on our behaviour and the environment around us. Asur is mainly give us this message. The whole story is written and executed well. The writer has made a great combination of science and mythology. If you like thriller then I must say this series will not disappoint you.\n",
      "Review 636: This is the best ever tv series so far created in the history of Indian Entertainment Industry. One may get psychic if anyone excessively involved in this Psychological thrilling at the time of watching and on the other hand if one missed a single scene, can completely messed up with the whole story and could be lost into a deep sea. There are so many layers in the story & screenplay which can easily engage every minute of yours and will tied you up with the wheel of events & emotions. The story writing is so fine, flawless & accurate and the timing is so impeccable that you would keep yourself busy for connecting all the dots. Every component of this series starting from acting, story, screenplay, music, direction everything is astonishing. It should get 10 on 10, atleast 9 not below that, but don't know why it is rated 8.5 in user rating in IMDB. I just wonder those who gives below 9 what more they are expecting. I would give 9.5 but can't able to do that because of non-availibity of fraction point rating system here, hence giving 9. This one is already rambling in the league of arsenal.\n",
      "Review 637: I have never seen such a phenomenal act by anyone. This series has all the excitement, hype and thrill we want. The direction is superb. Background music is given perfectly. Totally love watching. Recommending to all.\n",
      "Review 638: This series is jus fabulous. I love watching it, my family likes it. Also Arshad Sir is brilliant in this. He has done his job so effortlesly. Such series are not made frequently so watch it and enjoy this series called \"ASUR\".\n",
      "Review 639: The concept and story are unique especially at the time when Indian entertainment industry is synonymous with garbage producing machine.The whole series is engaging and not so predictable.The only negative of this series is its misrepresentation of Hinduism which is evident (sometimes very clearly & many times indirectly).\n",

      "Review 645: Simply a continuation of the vile individual who consistently deceives Dhanjay Rajpoot and his group. The character has been effectively portrayed by Arshad Warsi, and the script is superb. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are in identical circumstances. The premise of the show (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the incorporation of legendary mythology complement the plot flawlessly. Other cast members also performed admirably, but some passages were superfluous and prolonged the narrative until episode 8. If the editing had been more refined, this show's first six episodes would have been excellent. If you combine Anupriya Goenka's Hacking scenes, you'll get a 30-minute episode in which she implements (for amusement) geek-created codes.\n",

But believe me when I say it is a jewel, unadulterated gold, in the culture of Indian television and web series. Never before have I written such a positive review for a film or web series.

I had absolutely no complaints because of this. A relief was a Hindi suspense that held my attention until the very end. Those who admire Asur's previous films will appreciate Arshad Warsi's return. The plot and direction of this film are both outstanding. The entire ensemble has impeccable coordination. Everyone who.\n",
      "Review 649: Web series. However, after viewing ASUR, I have completely changed my mind and now consider it the greatest Indian web series to date. It is unsettling because it is predicated on truth and severity, and it is truly \"The Best.\" This will stimulate your interest. Both Voot choose and this web series have received little attention. But trust me when I say that this is one of the Golden Nuggets of Indian television and web series. Never before have I been so excited about a movie or web series. It is encouraging to observe the improvement of Bollywood and Indian television. In the past, our industry has been known for its exceptional actors, but in recent years, filmmakers have shifted their attention to narrative. Our writing quality is also improving. Finally, an uncomplicated superlative.\n",

The hero takes centre stage and conducts body searches in exotic locales, and the scenery is so breathtaking that it generates tension until the very end and is excellent overall.

It is occasionally a bit sluggish, but it aids comprehension of the narrative and Indian mythology. As a consequence, I was unconcerned.

All of the actors, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riyadh Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and PawanChopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will undoubtedly win the award. It is the type of series that prompts viewers to question whether or not what they believe to be proper is in fact correct. This series does a fantastic job of combining technology and folklore. I highly recommend it, and sure, I am looking foreword to the third season. This is an outstanding suspense novel that will keep you wondering throughout. The trailer does not do credit to the film.\n",

My thoughts continually return to that instant. Without exaggeration, one of the loveliest concerts I've ever attended. From the script to the direction to the acting, I adored every aspect of this film. I completed Asur in a single session. Never before have I watched an entire Web series in one session.

I was amazed by everything, from the plot to the performances. The collective labour of the group is truly astounding. It must absolutely be seen. Holy smokes!! Is all that is necessary.

It must be shown to audiences worldwide, not just in India. His team of writers, led by Gaurav Shukla, did an outstanding job. Thanks to Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt, Oni Sen's direction is outstanding. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh deliver outstanding performances. The performance will leave a lasting impression. I'm looking forwards to the second seasonries.\n",
      "Review 703: Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment. The concept is extremely beautiful. It was great to see Arsad Warsi on television again after so long. Incredible is the concept of two universes and their struggle against evil. I chose to watch the movie despite not having seen the trailer. Asur is more than a straightforward crime thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a cat-and-mouse game in quest of the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur. It causes us to doubt our morals, beliefs, and values at various junctures, as well as the decisions we make in extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 704: The absence of explicit sexual content and language distinguishes this series from others. If desired, include everyone in the household. Seven or eight hours is suggested for viewing the entire series. Moreover, the cinematography and performances are excellent. The entire series is outstanding from start to finish. Asur's high favorability ratings are merited. There is no singular vulnerable point. My Asur hangover has reached its peak. The opening and concluding music are extremely ominous. My thoughts continually return to that instant. Without. I really request to all my friends watching this.\n",
      "Review 705: Standing out. The narrative moves quickly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series does an excellent job of incorporating mythology and technology. The use of the Vedas and other ancient religions to explain the killer's motives is both fascinating and ominous. The series also examines the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it can be used for evil...Here are some of the series' advantages anddisadvantages: Pros: *Excellent acting *Well-paced story *Thrilling suspense *Thought-provoking It combines mythology and technology. Some of the visual effects are inferior. -Several plot gaps exist.\n",
      "Review 706: Initially when I saw this series on Voot, I thought that it won't be up to the mark. There was no review of this on IMDb till then. I watched the first episode for free and liked it quite a lot. But unfortunately, other was paid so I waited for few days and got all the episode from a source and watched it within 2 days.The series is superb. All the cast did a great job especially DJ and Nikhil.I am now looking for the second season as the last episode says \"The End is the Beginning\" and as was the episode.The actual Shubh was revealed in the last few minutes and now the actual story will begin.Good to see series like these are now made in India.\n",

Yah, there are minor errors, apart from that each and every things are crafted with precise.Casting is just awesome.Arshad warsi as DJ is good as he has always been.Barun Sobti as Nikhil Nair steal the show, what an incredible acting. He really needs to get limelight. Throughout the movie he acted so natural and flawless.Child actor who has done the character of antagonist can't be any less, even eyes says a lot. What a dark acting.Narrating style of the series is also very good. How they link it to Mythology takes your attention.Dialogues well written.It is must watch guys.\n",

He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely appreciated it.\n",

The narrative proceeds swiftly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series combines mythology and technology seamlessly. The use of the Vedas and other ancient texts to explain the killer's motives is both intriguing and disquieting.

      "Review 714: It is difficult to sum up Asur's performance. Expressing nuanced feelings in a direct way is surprisingly easy. Expert in forensics who just settled down with his family and is married to a fierce Asur with whom he has emotional ups and downs despite their obvious mental compatibility. There was a palpable sense of dread throughout this entire narrative. The writing is quite effective at keeping your attention throughout the entire movie. Bickram Ghosh, in my opinion, did a fantastic job with the score. The final scene's soundtrack was really ominous. Asur is the latest movie I've watched. Congratulations to the entire cast and crew for creating such a wonderful performance that skilfully blends mythology, astrology, science, and psychological study. Your comments are much appreciated.\n",
      "Review 715: The cunning villen descendants who continue to con Dhanjay rajpoot and his crew. Arshad Warsi's portrayal of the well-developed character was outstanding. Varun Arora and Amey wagh are in identical circumstances. The use of artificial intelligence to analyse and predict user activity is a seamless addition to the show's established narrative. Starcast as a whole has been a triumph, but the narrative is unnecessarily drawn out until the eighth episode. If the episodes were reduced more effectively, the show may have lasted longer than its first season.

      "Review 717: This is one of the finest Bollywood films I have ever seen. Amazing acting abilities My personal preference DR. BARUN SOBTI This has been the best web series I've seen in a while. I am a fan of Hollywood web series, but this has made me eager for Bollywood content. I also hope the next season comes with the same perfection and excellence. Please view it; it's a work of art. This contains no spoilers, although I'm compelled to tell you one. This exceeds the definition of a suspense. It tricks the psyche. At the midpoint of the series, the narrative develops beautifully and leaves the reader wanting more! This programme is a genuine \"psychological thriller.\n",
      "Review 718: Arshad Warsi, you hit the nail on the head. It has a fantastic narrative that is skilfully handled. All of the characters performed admirably in their parts. Just finished Asur, the best Hindi web series combining science and Hindu philosophy. Outstanding work, my friend! I'm looking forwards to the next episode! Asur will get every prise this year. This web series receives a perfect 10 in terms of performance, production, and plot. What have I just finished... I was determined to watch this once all of the episodes were out, and guess what? They became available over the weekend. I'm not over it yet... Who precisely is Kali? When will this be over? Clever writing will keep you guessing about what will happen next. I can only hope that the time spent by creators and publishers is appropriate.\n",
      "Review 719: Into the inner depths of the plot. The series' great storytelling talent is evidenced by the exceptional characteriszation of various characters as well as the continuity across episodes. The series serves as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching implications of contemporary warfare by highlighting its catastrophic impacts. More online series with such high-quality writing should be produced by the film business. As a result, I recommend that Season 3 production begin as soon as feasible. Arshad Warsi's interesting characteriszation of the main guy adds to the series' perplexity, and the writing is terrific.\n",
      "Review 720: In my opinion, if you are showing a Good vs Evil theme in a movie or tv show, it's always good to show evil being defeated comprehensively. The world needs it. There's already enough going on around us, so we try to find some solace in the entertainment world. I think the makers got too carried away by the plot which ended in a twisted finale.\n",

      "Review 724: One of the best thriller i ever seen nd i must say this is the best Indian series\n",
      "Review 725: It is a mind-blowing series because of the acting, plot, aesthetics, music, and, most importantly, the story. All of the actors, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will certainly receive the honour. It's the type of series that makes you question what is right and whether what we believe to be right is actually accurate. The creators of this series exerted substantial effort to combine technology and myth. Highly recommended...watch it, and certainly, you should look forwards to the third season. This is a mind-boggling suspense novel that will provoke thought. The trailer does not do justice to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensics, excellent background music, and an outstanding screenplay/plot. This should not be ignored.\n",
      "Review 726: Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to the next endeavour. The concept is brilliant. It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi on film again after a lengthy absence. Wonderful is the concept of two planets confronting an evil aspect. I viewed it without viewing the trailer due to the bio. Asur is more than just a criminal thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti pursue a self-proclaimed serial murderer, Asur. It compels us to reevaluate our principles, beliefs, and values at various points in our lives, as well as the decisions we make when confronted with extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 727: The story, performances, images, music, and especially the sound design all contribute to making this an unforgettable series. Arshad Warsi, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra all achieved career-best performances. There's little doubt that this act will win first prise. This is the kind of show that forces us to question our fundamental beliefs. This show has made an effort to blend sci-fi and fantasy aspects. Recommended with caution: you will be impatiently waiting for season three. This incredible mystery will keep you up at night thinking about it. It looks far better than the preview suggests. It's has a great story, beautiful music, forensics, mythology, and psychology. There is no way to ignore this.\n",
      "Review 728: Everyone worked really hard to make it great. The exceptional work that Gaurav Shukla has produced in writing merits special appreciation. In addition to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team's outstanding effort. Waiting for my next task at this time. It was great to have arsad warsi back on TV after such a lengthy hiatus. It's mind-blowing to think that evil exists in two realities at once. The summary sold me on the film without even having to see the trailer. While it does follow Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti as they try to track down the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur, Asur is more than simply a basic criminal thriller. Our morals, ethics, and the kinds of choices we make when we're under pressure are all called into question as we go through the ordeal.\n",
      "Review 729: What a series. Just mind blowing.Full time I was thrilled.\n",
      "Review 730: In this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming increasingly alienated and lonely, are we more susceptible to individuals who appear kind and logical but are actually pursuing their own agenda, vying for control over you, and willing to manipulate your thoughts and minds to do their bidding? Few action passages sandwiched by taut horror create exotic suspense. This action film is the best in a series in which the protagonist investigates gruesome murders in remote locations surrounded by breathtaking scenery. Very ingeniously conceived and carried out. Fans of the genre should not pass up this opportunity. After viewing the entire season of this programme, I feel qualified to provide descriptive terminology. MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC STUNNING BREATHTAKING.\n",
      "Review 731: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDING INTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal.

      "Review 733: This series is distinguished by its lack of immorality and foul language. It is appropriate for family entertainment. This course will not disappoint if you devote 7-8 hours to it. Moreover, the performances and cinematography are also exceptional. There is not a single flaw in the series. Asur is not only a popular series, but it also merits its popularity. This contains no flaws; everything is ideal. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. Beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It has become ingrained in my mind. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot resist praising the screenplay, direction, and acting. I watched Asur in a single day. I have never before completed a Web series in a single day. Finally, a programme with Western intelligence. Thank you for creating such an outstanding series.\n",
      "Review 734: Arshad Warsi, you nailed it. It has a brilliant plot and is expertly executed. All of the characters played their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy. Outstanding effort, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! This year, every award will go to Asur. In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end? Clever writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the amount of time taken by creators and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 735: Because of the performances, narrative, aesthetics, music, and, most importantly, the tale, it is a mind-blowing series. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra all delivered great performances. This series will undoubtedly be honoured. It's the kind of series that makes you wonder what's right and whether what we think we know is correct. The authors of this series worked hard to mix technology with folklore. Highly recommended...watch it and, without a doubt, look forwarding to the third season. This is a mind-bending suspense tale that will make you think. The trailer does not do the film credit. Mythology, psychology, forensics, great background music, and a fantastic screenplay/plot. This should not be overlooked.\n",
      "Review 736: In addition, the performers, director, and music. It's certainly worth noting. The second season is eagerly anticipated. After watching the full season, I'd want to use a few words to define the show. SPELLBOUNDING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can confidently state that the performance is of the greatest level and calibre. It must be shown to audiences all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, the inventor and author, has done an excellent job. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal's work was efficiently monitored by Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh. The concert will live on in your memories. I'm looking forwards to the second season.\n",
      "Review 737: Everyone put out their best effort to ensure the success of the event. I think what you've written is fantastic, Gaurav Shukla. As for Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team, please give them my best wishes as well. The next venture is something I've been eager to get started on. What a fantastic concept! After a long hiatus, it was fantastic to finally see Arsad Warsi in a film. It's a brilliant idea to have two planets work together to defeat a shared foe. The bio alone made me want to see the movie, without even seeing a trailer. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti's narrative, which follows two forensic professionals on the trail of the alleged serial murderer Asur, is more than just a thriller. Everything we want, everything we believe, everything we value, and everything we do in the face of hardship is questioned.\n",
      "Review 738: The online series definitely took a lot of time and effort to make, as the complex plot effortlessly draws in viewers. The exceptional storytelling ability of the series is on full display in the show's vivid character portrayals and consistent storylines. The programme is a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of modern warfare through its depiction of its devastation. More high-quality screenplays like this should be used to create web series in the film business. As a result, I strongly urge the creators to speed up work on Season 3. The show's enigmatic mood stems in large part from Arshad Warsi's hypnotic portrayal as the protagonist and the show's superb language.\n",
      "Review 739: Previously, I thought that the finest Indian online series were Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon. After watching ASUR, I am confident in saying that it is the finest Indian web series ever made. This is terrifying because it is based on truth and cruelty; it is excellent and deserves to be called \"The Best.\" There hasn't been much advertising for this web series or Voot choose. But trust me when I say this is top-notch Indian web stuff. I have never praised a movie or web series so enthusiastically. It's heartening to see Bollywood and Indian television on the upswing. Talented actors and actresses have always been in demand in our profession, but story has become increasingly important to filmmakers in recent years. We've also gotten better as writers.

      "Review 746: Asur 2 is an episode-by-episode mythological thriller with incredible developments. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team are routinely duped by a recurring gang of swindle artists. Arshad Warsi has done the character justice, who is so ingeniously crafted. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh share a similar situation. The premise of the show is perfectly adapted to the underlying principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the combination of legendary tales. Other members of the Starcast have also performed admirably, but certain passages are so lengthy as to be superfluous and extend the narrative until episode eight. If the editing had been precise, six episodes would have been sufficient for this programme.

I hope the second season surpasses the first. This article contains no spoilers, but I am compelled to reveal one. However, I will not because the film is an artistic creation. This series is more than just a suspense. It stimulates mental activity. The story advances effectively, and the conclusion leaves you wanting more!

The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is demonstrated by the exceptional characterisation of multiple characters and the continuity between episodes. By exposing the destructive effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry must produce more web series with such high-quality screenplays. Therefore, I advise the creators to begin Season 3 production as soon as possible.

      "Review 754: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything in Asur is excellent, but the writing kept me puzzled and captivated until the very end. I have watched each episode of Asur. It is very impressive. It occasionally proceeds slowly, but this helps the reader comprehend the plot and Indian mythology. So I had no objections. After a lengthy absence, I watched an Urdu suspense that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears alongside Asur on a digital projection for the audience and his followers. The script and execution of this film are outstanding. Each performer has flawless action synchronisation. Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable.

The script is excellent, keeping your attention throughout the entire movie. The amazing score was composed and performed by Bickram Ghosh. I got chills throughout the last scene and score. I finished watching Asur a few days ago. Extensive research was done into mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology, and the amazing links between these fields are evident throughout the production of this masterpiece. I want to congratulate everyone who worked on the show. Every single second was fantastic fun for me.\n",

But believe me when I say that this is one of Indian television and web series' Golden Nuggets. Never before have I been so enthralled by a film or a web series. It's encouraging to see Bollywood and Indian television improving. Our profession has traditionally been recognised for its excellent performers, but in recent years, directors have changed their focus to story. Our writing is also becoming better. Finally, a straightforward superlative...\n",
      "Review 757: Excellent series one of the best in the business..must watch if your fan of crime thriller scenes.\n",
      "Review 758: This series definitely challanges all big online platform like amazon & netflix in terms of quality content.Its a must watch thriller with many unforgettable one liners that will force you to introspectAnd a big round of applause for varun & arshad warshi\n",
      "Review 759: Just finishing up season 1 and can't wait to watch the season 2....\n",
      "Review 760: Well, if you're a fan of suspenseful web shows, then this one is a perfect watch for you. Amazing work done by the starcast and the plot is equally awesome. Nothing fabled. Speaks, what's real and practical. It gets in your mind at the climax. YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS THIS ONE.\n",
      "Review 761: There is a mistake in the part of the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing the victim. The writing in Asur is excellent; I was engaged and fascinated right up to the final page. The totality of Asur is up to date in my knowledge. It has a taste that is out of this world. Regardless of the dull spots, this is a great way to learn about the story and Indian mythology. In retrospect, it wasn't that bad. After a long break, I saw a gripping Urdu thriller that I couldn't stop thinking about. This time, Arshad Warsi appears on the big screen alongside Asur in front of his fans. Outstanding screenplay and expert direction. The performers' synchronisation and timing in every scene is superb. Everyone worked really hard to make it great. The exceptional work that Gaurav Shukla has produced in writing merits special appreciation. In addition to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team's outstanding effort. Waiting for my next task at this time.\n",
      "Review 762: Awesome....but..need some development..hoe tht.next season will be great\n",
      "Review 763: Due to the numerous plot developments in each episode, Asur 2 is an excellent mythological thriller that will keep you captivated until the very end. It is simply a continuation of the vile individual who consistently deceives Dhanjay Rajpoot and his group. The character has been effectively portrayed by Arshad Warsi, and the script is superb. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are in identical circumstances. The premise of the show (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the incorporation of legendary mythology complement the plot flawlessly. Other cast members also performed admirably, but some passages were superfluous and prolonged the narrative until episode 8. If the editing had been more refined, this show's first six episodes would have been excellent. If you combine Anupriya Goenka's Hacking scenes, you'll get a 30-minute episode in which she implements (for amusement) geek-created codes.\n",
      "Review 764: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything about Asur is superb, but the writing in particular kept me guessing until the very end. I've seen every Asur episode. It is remarkable. It is occasionally a bit sluggish, but it aids comprehension of the narrative and Indian mythology. As a consequence, I was unconcerned. I eventually witnessed a riveting Hindi programme that endured to its conclusion after a lengthy wait. This time, Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur on a digital projection for the audience and supporters. Fantastic film with an excellent plot and execution. All of the performers' actions are perfectly timed. Everyone involved did their utmost to make the event memorable. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to the next endeavour.\n",
      "Review 765: This story is all about how everyone is enemy in different ways. There is a dark side of everyone. This show teaches us that never treat our children that you are useless as this will create a major impact on there mind and this affects there life forever. One word for Asur is \"Gem\"\n",
      "Review 766: Everyone there did their best to ensure it was a memorable experience. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent literary work. We would also like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I am excited to see what transpires next. The concept is ingenious. After a lengthy absence, it was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi back on the big screen. It is a brilliant concept to pit two domains against one terrible power. I chose to see the film without first observing the trailer due to the synopsis. The story of forensics experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti as they pursue the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur is more than just a crime thriller. Our principles, beliefs, and values, in addition to our responses to challenging situations, are all questioned.\n",
      "Review 767: The second season of Asur is a well-crafted and intriguing drama. The performances are exceptional, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti particularly standing out. The narrative moves quickly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series does an excellent job of incorporating mythology and technology. The use of the Vedas and other ancient religions to explain the killer's motives is both fascinating and ominous. The series also examines the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it can be used for evil... Here are some of the series' advantages anddisadvantages: Pros: *Excellent acting *Well-paced story *Thrilling suspense *Thought-provoking It combines mythology and technology. Some of the.\n",
      "Review 768: It is a mind-blowing series because of the acting, plot, aesthetics, music, and, most importantly, the story. All of the actors, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will certainly receive the honour. It's the type of series that makes you question what is right and whether what we believe to be right is actually accurate. The creators of this series exerted substantial effort to combine technology and myth. Highly recommended...watch it, and certainly, you should look forwards to the third season. This is a mind-boggling suspense novel that will provoke thought. The trailer does not do justice to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensics, excellent background music, and an outstanding screenplay/plot. This should not be ignored.\n",
      "Review 769: Mr. Warsi, you have hit the nail on the head. The picture is well written and directed. In their individual capacities, everyone did a fantastic job. The final episode of Asur, the best Hindi online series to reconcile science and Hinduism, has recently aired. I can't wait until the next installment comes out. That's a huge deal, man. Asur will be unstoppable this year. We give this web series a perfect score of 10 because of how well it is acted, directed, and written. Oh my God, what have I done... I've opted to watch it this weekend because that's when all the episodes were made available. I still can't believe that happened to me... Where does Kali come from, exactly? When is this madness going to stop? You won't be able to stop wondering what will happen next, thanks to the author's clever writing. I can only hope that the time authors and publishers put in is commensurate with the quality of their output.\n",
      "Review 770: Asur 2 is the pinnacle of legendary suspense, with each episode revealing more about Villen's deceitful individuals who continue to mislead Dhanjay Rajpoot and his group. Arshad Warsi delivered an outstanding performance as the well-developed protagonist. Amey Wagh and Varun Arora are in the same boat. The program's central principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) complements the timeless narrative well. Everyone else has done an excellent job, but the story doesn't really start going until episode 8. If it had been trimmed properly, this show might not have made it past the first season. Anupriya Goenka will appear in a collection of hacking sequences. The show will barely last 30 minutes, and she will (ironically) perform plays created by geeks for geeks.\n",
      "Review 771: Arshad Warsi, you are entirely accurate. It's well-executed, and the story is excellent. The entire cast performed an outstanding job in their individual parts. Asur, the best Hindi web series, is a superb fusion of science and Hindu spiritual concepts. My attention has been peaked, and I eagerly await the next episode. Asur will win every award conceivable this year. This web series receives a perfect 10 for its amazing performers, directing, and narrative. I can't believe I finally finished it. This weekend, when all of the episodes are published, is ideal because that's when they were shot, so I'll give it a chance then. The shock has only now subsided... Identify Kali and tell us about him. How much longer can this go on? Good writing keeps the reader guessing until the very last page. Hopefully, manufacturing and distribution will be completed quickly.\n",
      "Review 772: This movie touches a good social message, A Child Future is depends upon his/her upbringing. It totally depends upon child parents whether they make the child asur or a good human it is higly entertaining as well.\n",
      "Review 773: Very nice and entertaining web series on a completely new genre. An example of Brilliant acting, direction and screenplay. must watch\n",
      "Review 774: Pretty much everything you ask for, one of the best web series out there, in fact my favorite Indian web series so far. Might take you two or three episodes to start feeling the real thrill, but once you fall for it there is no going back. I just couldn't stop watching from one episode to another, so I had to complete all the episodes within two days. Even after that, you just can't wait for next season. I've been waiting for next season for a long time now. Other web series wouldn't feel anywhere close to this one, so I had some issues regarding what to watch next after watching this one. I really hope season 2 will live up to the expectations, because they have a lot of pressure after the masterpiece they have given us.\n",

      "Review 780: Finally I found a one web series called Asur which I can watch with my family. A complete family entertainer.\n",
      "Review 781: This series separates out from others due in part to the absence of vulgarity and profanity. Including the entire family is optional. Seven or eight hours are required to watch the entire series. The acting and cinematography are both of the highest calibre. There is not a solitary flaw in the entirety of the series. Asur's high popularity ratings are well-deserved. There is not a solitary weak point. I currently have a severe Asur hangover. Beginning and ending scores are extremely ominous. I cannot stop replaying it in my mind. I can honestly say it was one of the greatest concerts I've ever attended. I appreciated every aspect of the film, including the script, direction, and acting. In one sitting, I read the entirety of Asur. Before today, I had never watched an entire Web series in one session. At last, an intelligent programme that can contend with the West. Please accept my heartfelt gratitude for putting on such a magnificent performance.\n",
      "Review 782: The latest series on #voot is called \"asur,\" which means \"evil,\" implying that everyone has a dark side. What happens if we replace one value with another? The significance of inborn fury to your well-being. Even if your viewpoint is correct, it won't always convince everyone. This is a sad tale. Each of the eight episodes adds new layers to the overall narrative. The film's director, acting, and script will blow your mind. The group's efforts as a whole are extraordinary. Required to follow the rules. What can I say other than \"holy crap\"? That's a huge sum of money! What a fantastic start to Select voting! A performance by an Indian like this is something I have never seen before. The script, the director, the acting-it's all superb. It combines mystery fiction with mythology brilliantly.\n",
      "Review 783: As a series name, \"asur\" refers to the emergence of evil within the human psyche. The reorganisation of priorities. How far your inner asur will go to defend you. It is possible that your concept only applies to you and not to others. A tale of despair that is masterfully crafted. There are a total of eight episodes, and each one delves deeply into the story. I was amazed by everything, from the plot to the performances. The collective labour of the group is truly astounding. It must absolutely be seen. Holy smokes!! Is all that is necessary. Is this not a lengthy series? What an excellent beginning for Voot choose! This type of Indian television programme has never been broadcast in the United States. The script, direction, and performances were all outstanding. It is a wonderful blend of mystery and folklore.\n",
      "Review 784: It's a mind blowing series ..eagerly waiting for the next season..\n",
      "Review 785: This series is distinguished by its lack of obscenity and foul language in preference of authentic substance. You may have a pleasant time with your family. If you devote seven to eight hours to this series, you will not be disappointed. Lastly, the performances and photography are both excellent. The entire series is flawless; not a single flaw exists. Asur is not only a popular programme, but it also merits its popularity. There are no flaws; everything is perfect. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. The beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It is ingrained in me. Honestly, this is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot get enough of the story, direction, and acting in this film. I completed watching Asur in one day. It is the first time I have ever viewed two Web programmes on the same day. Finally, a show with as much intelligence as western programmes. Thank you for creating such an excellent series.\n",
      "Review 786: I used to think that the greatest Indian web shows were Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon. Voot has chosen ASUR as India's top online series of all time. The most compelling aspects of \"The Very Best\" are its reality, harshness, and gloomy tone. You are stuck where you are and there is no way out. There are no obvious commercial interruptions in either of these web shows. An imperial asset in the realm of Indian television and online programmes. I've never been one to give a movie or web series such a glowing review. The quality of Indian cinema and television has dramatically increased in recent years. Despite the fact that Hollywood has long boasted brilliant performers, directors have only recently started placing a larger focus on story. The same may be said about the quality of our writing. To sum up, it was nothing short of astounding.\n",
      "Review 787: The script has been brilliantly written & acting of arshad warsi is quite good.the play have higher meanings.& twist of the play is just amazing.the content of the asur is unbelievable.must watch it.\n",
      "Review 788: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDINGINTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The concert will forever remain in your memory. I eagerly anticipate.\n",
      "Review 789: This series is distinguished by its lack of immorality and foul language. It is appropriate for family entertainment. This course will not disappoint if you devote 7-8 hours toit. Moreover, the performances and cinematography are also exceptional. There is not a single flaw in the series. Asur is not only a popular series, but it also merits its popularity. This contains no flaws; everything is ideal. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. Beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It has become ingrained in my mind. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot resist praising the screenplay, direction, and acting. I watched Asur in a single day. I have never before completed a Web series in a single day. Finally, a programme with Western intelligence. Thank you for creating such an outstanding series.\n",

Best from India so far I think.a mix of spirituality, religion, in sight of human brain and a lot. Should be exposed to rest of the world as well.It's written so smartly, and executed so well. Available on Voot, wherein 1st episode is free and rest require subscription and you won't stop yourself from buying it.The title is perfect for the series, Asur indeed represent the true side of human.Must watch by every one.\n",

One thing about which I am very confident about is - Its one of the best Indian TV series so far. Amazing acting, Amazing direction, Super Amazing cinematography and what not. It was worth watching in a single go. I was completely engaged in the storyline. I would personally recommend it. It's totally different and its very much unpredictable. Good Job Team\n",

      "Review 808: Alternatively, the performers, dancers, and musicians. This is a rule you should follow. I desperately need a second season! After viewing the full season, I feel I can adequately describe this show. Having been there at the performance, I can say without reservation that it is of the highest possible standard and quality. It has to be seen by people all across the world, not only in India. Amazing work has been done by creator and author Gaurav Shukla. The team of Niren H. Bhatt, Vineet Chhawal, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriya Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh was expertly overseen by Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, and others. Your memories of the show will last forever. Season two has me really excited.\n",
      "Review 809: As the title of a new #voot series, the term asur, which means \"evil,\" refers to the origin of asur within the human body. The manner in which one priority replaces another. The manner in which your inner fury saves your life. Your viewpoint may be correct for some individuals but not for others. An exceptionally well-written tale of melancholy. Each of the eight episodes completely immerses the audience in the storyline. As with the performances, the conversation with the director is mute. The sum of the team's efforts is astounding. Both must and must not be ignored. Three words: oh my God! What a collection! What a beginning for Vote Select! I've never seen anything like this on Indian television before. The script, direction, and acting are all outstanding. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",

      "Review 811: The sequence where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torture another character was botched in editing. Asur is well written; I was left guessing till the very end. The entirety of Asur has been watched by me. I find that very astounding. It may be slow at times, but the story's basic principles and Indian mythology are well worth the wait. As a result, I experienced no pain. After what seemed like an eternity, I finally got to see a gripping and exciting Hindi thriller. Arshad Warsi returns as Asur, but this time he does it on a digital screen for the benefit of fans and onlookers. The film's writing and direction are both superb. The synchronisation of the dancers' movements is flawless. Everyone put out their best effort to ensure the success of the event. I think what you've written is fantastic, Gaurav Shukla. As for Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team, please give them my best wishes as well. The next venture is something I've been eager to get started on.\n",
      "Review 812: The high production values of this online series ensure that it quickly becomes engrossing to its viewers. Character diversity and excellent consistency across episodes contribute to the show's extraordinary narrative. The series serves as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching impacts of modern combat by exposing their tragic consequences. More shows like these, available exclusively online, are exactly what the film business needs. Season 3 of this show, please, please, please, be made available as soon as possible. The series' captivating protagonist and great dialogue are both because to Arshad Warsi's spellbinding performance.\n",
      "Review 813: Asur 2 is an episode-by-episode mythological thriller with incredible developments. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team are routinely duped by a recurring gang of swindle artists. Arshad Warsi has done the character justice, who is so ingeniously crafted. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh share a similar situation. The premise of the show is perfectly adapted to the underlying principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the combination of legendary tales. Other members of the Starcast have also performed admirably, but certain passages are so lengthy as to be superfluous and extend the narrative until episode eight. If the editing had been precise, six episodes would have been sufficient for this programme. Hacking Sequences is a 30-minute brief episode in which Anupriya Gokhale implements algorithms created by nerds for geeks.\n",

He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely appreciated it.\n",

The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is demonstrated by the exceptional characterisation of multiple characters and the continuity between episodes. By exposing the destructive effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry must produce more web series with such high-quality screenplays. Therefore, I advise the creators to begin Season 3 production as soon as possible.

In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end?

I am a fan of Hollywood web series, but this has made me eager for Bollywood content. I also hope the next season comes with the same perfection and excellence. Please view it; it's a work of art. This contains no spoilers, although I'm compelled to tell you one. This exceeds the definition of a suspense. It tricks the psyche. At the midpoint of the series, the narrative develops beautifully and leaves the reader wanting more! This programme is a genuine \"psychological thriller\"\n",
      "Review 821: The second season of Asur is a well-crafted and intriguing drama. The performances are exceptional, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti particularly standing out. The narrative moves quickly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series does an excellent job of incorporating mythology and technology. The use of the Vedas and other ancient religions to explain the killer's motives is both fascinating and ominous.

It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi on film again after a lengthy absence. Wonderful is the concept of two planets confronting an evil aspect. I viewed it without viewing the trailer due to the bio. Asur is more than just a criminal thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti pursue a self-proclaimed serial murderer, Asur. It compels us to reevaluate our principles, beliefs, and values at various points in our lives, as well as the decisions we make when confronted with extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 823: Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riyadh Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will undoubtedly win the award. It is the type of series that prompts viewers to question whether or not what they believe to be proper is in fact correct. This series does a fantastic job of combining technology and folklore. I highly recommend it, and sure, I am looking foreword to the third season. This is an outstanding suspense novel that will keep you wondering throughout. The trailer does not do credit to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensics, gorgeous background music, and an excellent screenplay/story. Avoid missing out.\n",
      "Review 824: This is an amazing series because to the plot, acting, visuals, music, and notably the sound design. All-time highs were set by Arshad Warsi, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra. It's safe to assume that this performance will take home the gold. This is the type of programme that makes us reevaluate our most cherished ideals. There was an attempt made to combine elements of science fiction and fantasy in this presentation. Caution is advised, since you may become addicted and wait expectantly for Season 3. You will be wondering about this fantastic mystery long after you've gone to bed. The actual product seems far more impressive than the teaser. Amazing plot, stunning score, forensics, mythology, and psychological depth. There is no escaping this reality.\n",
      "Review 825: The singers, the dancers, the musicians, etc. You should always adhere to this guideline. I really must have more seasons! Now that I've seen the entire season, I feel confident in my ability to explain the programme. Having witnessed the performance myself, I can confidently attest to its exceptional quality. It's important that it be viewed all around the world, not only in India. Creator/author Gaurav Shukla has done incredible work. Expert direction was provided by Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, and others, who oversaw a team that included Niren H. Bhatt, Vineet Chhawal, Anupriya Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh. The performance will remain in your mind forever. I can't wait for season two.\n",
      "Review 826: Watch 1 episode, and I can safely bet, you will watch all. Perfect for weekend binging!I would say, despite having no pillars like Said and Nawazuddin, this has a SUPER TIGHT grip on you, with stellar performances from all.Really makes you think on whats bad and what's good...and how this changes.

      "Review 828: Though I guessed the villain after 3 episode the series kept me glued to see the end . Thrilling and engaging.waiting for second season\n",
      "Review 829: What on earth is the problem with Nikhil? Does he have some kind of speech impediment? Why he can't open his mouth and speak clearly rather than mumbling. Either change the actor or Get someone Dubbed for him. And yes series is dud, dull, dark and pathetic on the whole.\n",
      "Review 830: The protagonist (Barun sobti) has the most irritating mumbled verbal expression.... During entire time it was hard to make out what the hell was he saying. Please get his voice dubbed if there is anyyyy chance of sequel or at most change the G it please.\n",
      "Review 831: Rank 1 in indian web series................Sooper dooper...\n",
      "Review 832: Story and making made this web series superhit. Doesn't matter who acted in this web series because story is very powerful and it's great mixture of mythology and present life. Shuddh Hindi conversation is mind blowing and want it to save for hear it again and again. only end will give us normal disappoint. All actors are justice to the Role but teen-ager villain and Ridhi Dogra made impact by those appearance. Must watch.\n",
      "Review 833: It is one of the psycho thriller which plays with our mind and we allow them to play ..This series proves that it's executed well by top notch underrated performances massive screenplay and hard hitting writingMust watch for people who like this type of genre..\n",
      "Review 834: What an amazing series ,whole concept is very nicely planned and potrait, how one character is associated with another one is superb .turns of mythological era into present world is superb .\n",

      "Review 838: Good written, Good fight scenes, camera is almost always on point and dialogues are also pretty entertaining\n",
      "Review 839: I have watched only the first pilot episode and it promises to be an exciting one. Comes across as a well made, well researched, authentic web series. There is enough ground work to roll out an action packed drama laced with realistic portrayals. There is also a lot of character build up and portents of impending volatile situations,\n",
      "Review 840: Great job from the creators of the show. Every episode keeps you engaged.\n",
      "Review 841: It has everything that viewers want to see. Rich story lines, strongly portrayed (and very human) personalities you can really warm to who play off each other brilliantly, all with their own distinctive quirks\n",

      "Review 848: A lot of information... And a lot of splendid performances... Just loved the storyline and the presentation\n",
      "Review 849: This mythological thriller series is totally amazing.. It's writing, performances, and specially some moments just chills down your spine.! The layered characters ,intersting take on mythology and serial killings literally makes it one if the best web series in India!. I suggest every one to watch it as it's both worth your time and money.\n",
      "Review 850: Congratulations to everyone involved in this excellent series.what a acting, what a concept. thanks all of cast\n",
      "Review 851: Congratulations to everyone involved in this excellent series.what a acting, what a concept. thanks all of cast\n",
      "Review 852: Watching Asur I am in mid but totally loved it Ridhi Ma'am Ab Session 2 Ka Wait Nahi Hota, Kab laa rahe ho ..? ‚ô† #Asur On Voot\n",
      "Review 853: Best ever Show or Movie or Web Series, whatever you say is Awesome! Everything they have shown a Reality.\n",
      "Review 854: After 3 episodes the whole concept of Asur (horror) goes away & it becomes a typical CID episode of taking viewers for granted on logical & technical front to find the culprit .Lab & control room in jail, police wife finding exact location of culprit with Fitbit, gas container finding process & many more scenes makes the whole last few episodes a glorified version of CID on Sony .. wonder how they were successful to get 8+ ratings from intellectual OTT viewers !!\n",
      "Review 855: The first episode of this thriller is awesome. It is so good, you would straight away go for the subscription button to watch the rest of the episodes. All the episodes will keep you hooked. I really loved it and watched all the episodes in one go. However, was a liitle disappointed by certain choices the makers have done in the final few episodes. Some of the things are not explained, which perhaps we will get to know in second season if there is one.The show is really well shot. Asur in his kid version is menacing and intriguing.\n",
      "Review 856: This is the best crime series I have ever seen. Arshad Warsi hasn't got many chances anywhere but in this series, he nailed it....Barun Sobti was best cast for the lead. Anu and Ridhi too did their jobs perfectly. End was satisfactory enough. If they can roll out second season, will be amazing...\n",
      "Review 857: Had high expectations on this, but it's just a crime thriller, nothing related to aghoris/dark-magic if you hoped so, also, it is far from technically accurate.There are several cyber hacks done by a regular software engineer, who can simply ping to the gateway of the router from windows CMD and can hack government website, databases, fitbit etc, there are linux commands open on 3-4 windows which they repeat on every scene. When you make a webseries at least you should do a basic research. I can go on, but I'm tired.\n",
      "Review 858: Two strong acting perfs from arshad and Mr. Nair. Story has all the elements seemingly for a gripping suspense story. however, as it reaches end, the last few episodes lack the correct story, and downright bad screenplays to be worth it, for me.\n",
      "Review 859: A super engaging and mind blowing thriller series.one of the best thriller series watched till date.\n",
      "Review 860: This is the best Bollywood movie I've ever seen. Everyone did an amazing job, but my personal favourite was BARUN SOBTI. I cannot wait for season two of this Arshad Warsi masterpiece. I don't know when I last saw a web series of this quality. My curiosity in Bollywood films and TV shows has been aroused by this, while I usually watch American online series. The first season set the bar pretty high, so here's hoping the second one lives up to it. Although there are no spoilers in this piece, I do want to talk about one thing. However, I won't do it here because filmmaking is its own creative endeavour. There is more to this series than just tension. It's a great way to get your mind working. The story progresses naturally, and the series' midpoint will leave you wanting more. The label \"psychological thriller\" does not do justice to the quality of this show.\n",
      "Review 861: Asur Season 2 is an expertly crafted and gripping drama. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobsi are two actors whose work stands out. The story is expertly paced, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat until the very end. Mythology and cutting-edge science complement one another nicely in this show. The killer's acts are explained in terms of ancient writings like the Vedas, which is both fascinating and terrifying. Several plot holes. Some subpar visual effects. Combines mythology and science. These are some of the advantages and disadvantages of the series, which also explores the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil.\n",
      "Review 862: This series is distinguished by its lack of immorality and foul language. It is appropriate for family entertainment. This course will not disappoint if you devote 7-8 hours to it. Moreover, the performances and cinematography are also exceptional. There is not a single flaw in the series. Asur is not only a popular series, but it also merits its popularity. This contains no flaws; everything is ideal. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. Beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It has become ingrained in my mind. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot resist praising the screenplay, direction, and acting. I watched Asur in a single day. I have never before completed a Web series in a single day. Finally, a programme with Western intelligence. Thank you for creating such an outstanding series.\n",
      "Review 863: Before viewing this online series, I believed that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon were the finest Indian web series. Voot has selected ASUR, which is the finest Indian online series to date. The film \"The Very Best\" is realistic, brutal, and terrifying. You cannot resign from your respective positions. There are no noteworthy advertisements for Voot Select or this web series. But trust me when I say that it is one of the Jewels, unadulterated Gold, of Indian television and web series culture. I have never rated a film or web series so highly. It is gratifying to observe the improvement of Indian film and television. Our industry has always had exceptional actors, but filmmakers are also putting more emphasis on plot. The quality of our content is also improving. One final word: extraord.\n",
      "Review 864: You have hit the target on the head, Mr. Warsi. It is a fantastic story that is also expertly directed. Congratulations to all of the characters, who all performed admirably. Asur, the finest Hindi web series in terms of science and Hindu philosophy, recently concluded. I'm looking forwards to the second installment. Outstanding effort, gentleman. This year, Asur will obtain every prise. This web series receives a perfect score due to its excellent acting, direction, and storyline. What did I just say... Guess what they did over the weekend? I'm not over it yet... What precisely is Kali's identity? When will this be over? Intelligent writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the time required by artists and publishers is not excessive.\n",
      "Review 865: Season 2 of Asur is a well-made and dramatic drama. Both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti deliver exceptional performances. The narrative proceeds swiftly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series combines mythology and technology seamlessly. The use of the Vedas and other ancient texts to explain the killer's motives is both intriguing and disquieting. The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil...Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are subpar. Several plot flaws.\n",

      "Review 867: Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment. The concept is extremely beautiful. It was great to see Arsad Warsi on television again after so long. Incredible is the concept of two universes and their struggle against evil. I chose to watch the movie despite not having seen the trailer. Asur is more than a straightforward crime thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a cat-and-mouse game in quest of the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur. It causes us to doubt our morals, beliefs, and values at various junctures, as well as the decisions we make in extreme.\n",
      "Review 868: It's slow but awesome.. finally the indian tv Industry have got their act together and we are thinking beyond \"saas bahu\" drama..\n",
      "Review 869: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to individuals who appear cordial and reasonable but are actually pursuing their own agenda, wielding control over you, andprepared to corrupt your thoughts and ideas? A few life-or-death action situations generate unusual tension among the audience. The hero takes centre stage and conducts body searches in exotic locales, and the scenery is so breathtaking that it generates tension until the very end and is excellent overall.Outstandingly competent writing and performance! A must-see for fans of suspense! After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. INTRIGUING THINK-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING BEWITCHING.\n",
      "Review 870: After observing the performance, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the highest calibre and quality. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. Suspense prevails throughout the series. You agonise about the future every minute and second. Excellent summary of the Psycho character. I was instantly drawn to this series upon my initial exposure to it. It's truly mind-boggling, and the story's premise is both intriguing and perplexing, which adds to the web series' intrigue. I frequently recommend this excellent online series to my peers, and I also enjoy viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 871: This is one of the best Bollywood films I've ever seen. Arshad Warsi's performance in BARUN SOBTI is the best I've ever seen, and I eagerly anticipate the second season. I haven't seen a better online series in quite some time. I enjoy watching Hollywood web series, but this has piqued my curiosity about Bollywood content. I hope the second season surpasses the first. This article contains no spoilers, but I am compelled to reveal one. However, I will not because the film is an artistic creation. This series is more than just a suspense. It stimulates mental activity. The story advances effectively, and the conclusion leaves you wanting more! This programme is a \"psychological thriller\" in the finest sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 872: This beautifully crafted web series immediately captivates its audience, bringing them deeply into the story's multiple levels. The seamless connection between episodes and the exceptional characterisation of numerous characters exemplify the series' exceptional storytelling ability. The series functions as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of modern warfare by depicting its lethal consequences. The film industry should produce a greater quantity of online programming of this calibre. Therefore, I respectfully request that Season 3 be concluded as quickly as possible. The language is excellent, and the main performance by Arshad Warsi lends the series a compelling character.\n",
      "Review 873: This series is distinguished by the absence of vulgarity and filthy language, in favour of genuine substance. You might enjoy a good time with your family. If you put out 7-8 hours of your time to watch this series, you will not be disappointed. Last but not least, the acting and photography are superb. The entire series is immaculate; there isn't a single fault. Asur is not just a popular show, but it also deserves to be. This has no weaknesses; everything is flawless. I'm suffering from an Asur hangover. The background music at the start and end is disturbing. It's instilled in me. To be honest, it's one of the best concerts I've ever seen. I can't get enough of the plot, direction, and performances. In one day, I completed watching Asur. It's the first time I've ever seen two Web programmes in a single day. Finally, a programme with as much brains as western shows. Thank you for putting up such an outstanding series.\n",
      "Review 874: Regarding effectiveness, Asur defies concise summarization. The quantity of emotion conveyed with a single gaze was astounding. He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely appreciated it.\n",
      "Review 875: The malevolent intent of Asur may be misunderstood. #voot content that is recent. The series' title alludes to the presence of asur within the human organism. The reorganisation of priorities. This is when your inner sourness manifests. Someone may concur with you, whereas someone else may disagree. This sorrowful tale was written well. There are a total of eight episodes, and each one becomes progressively involved in the story. You are impressed by both the performance and the dialogue. The group's commitment is remarkable. Not to be overlooked. What can you express in just three words? What an astounding performance! Voot select is off to an excellent beginning! This is unlike anything I've ever seen on Indian television. Everything about it was superb, from the writing to the direction to the performances. It effectively combines mythology and crime.\n",
      "Review 876: Are we more susceptible to individuals who appear to have our best interests at heart but seek control over us and are willing to manipulate our thoughts and ideas to do their bidding in this increasingly isolating and lonely high-tech, scientific environment? Interspersing periods of apprehensive terror with a few action sequences creates exotic tension. This is the finest of a series of action films in which the protagonist investigates enigmatic deaths in remote locations with breathtaking scenery. Excellent strategy, gorgeously executed. This is a must-watch for aficionados of the genre. As someone who has seen each episode of this season, I feel qualified to comment. OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY PHENOMENAL.\n",
      "Review 877: It is a mind-blowing series because of the acting, plot, aesthetics, music, and, most importantly, the story. All of the actors, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will certainly receive the honour. It's the type of series that makes you question what is right and whether what we believe to be right is actually accurate. The creators of this series exerted substantial effort to combine technology and myth. Highly recommended...watch it, and certainly, you should look forwards to the third season. This is a mind-boggling suspense novel that will provoke thought. The trailer does not do justice to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensics, excellent background music, and an outstanding screenplay/plot. This should not be ignored.\n",
      "Review 878: This is one of the best Bollywood films I've ever seen. Arshad Warsi's performance in BARUN SOBTI is the best I've ever seen, and I eagerly anticipate the second season.

      "Review 880: Everyone involved hoped for it to be truly remarkable. For his intelligent and well-written piece, we must thank Gaurav Shukla. I'd want to express my gratitude to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the great team. My future duties have not yet been decided. The idea is lovely. After what felt like an eternity, I was relieved to see Arsad Warsi in a movie again. It's astonishing that beings from other dimensions can work together to defeat evil. I would have gone to the theatre to see this movie regardless of the trailer. In Asur, we follow Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, two forensics professionals, as they investigate the case of a serial murderer. This book isn't your typical thriller. It forces us to reckon with our own moral compass and the weight of our choices in tense situations.\n",
      "Review 881: Each episode of Asur 2 is filled with mythological suspense and intrigue. The same conspiracy repeatedly tricks Dhanjay Rajpoot and his colleagues. To his credit, Arshad Warsi did honour to the writing. This is equally applicable to Amey wagh and Varun Arora. The premise of the show (using AI to predict and analyse user behaviour) and the legendary tale it recounts are a perfect match. Other Starcast members have also done an excellent job, but the story is too protracted due to unnecessary lengthy passages. If the editing had been precise, there could have been six episodes of this programme. Hacking sequences with Anupriya Gokhale will be a brief episode (approximately 30 minutes) in which she employs computer scientist-created algorithms for enthusiasts.\n",
      "Review 882: You put a halt to it, Mr. Warsi. It has a strong narrative and direction. Each and every actor was outstanding in their respective roles. Asur is the best Hindi web series that combines scientific enquiry with Hindu doctrine. Well done, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! Asur will receive every accolade this year. This web series' acting, production value, and plot all merit a perfect score of 10 out of 10. What in the world did I do... I intend to view this once all episodes have been released, and would you believe it? They were released last Friday or Saturday. I haven't gotten over it yet... Where does Kali originate? When will this be over? Subtle literary devices will keep you wondering about the conclusion. My principal concern is that creators and publishers take too much time.\n",
      "Review 883: The show's grandeur stems from the excellent performances of the cast as a whole as well as from the quality of its writing, structure, visuals, music, and plot. Incredible work has been done by Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riddhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra. The gold medal goes to this programme, no question. The information presented here can make you rethink some of your assumptions. This show made serious efforts to blend mythology and science. I can't stress how crucial it is that you read it enough. Incredible tension that doesn't let up until the last page. The teaser does not do credit to the whole film. This movie has it all: mythology, psychology, forensics, great music, and a well-crafted story. Do not let this wonderful chance pass you by.\n",
      "Review 884: This show stands out from the rest since it has no foul language and instead focuses entirely on the story. You and the household could have fun. Seven or eight hours of your time spent watching this series will not be wasted. Last but not least, the direction and cinematography are superb. There is not a single inaccuracy in the entire series. Asur is a well-liked TV show because of how good it is. Despite my Asur hangover, I see no problems with this. There is foreboding music in both the opening and closing credits. It's become a part of me now. Among the best concerts I've ever been to, this ranks near the top. The story, the directing, and the acting were all superb. Asur, the complete series, was seen in one sitting. It's really unusual for me to watch two Web series in one day. At last, a show that can hold its own intellectually against western media. I really admire the quality of the show you've created.\n",
      "Review 885: In the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character, there is an error. The writing in Asur is superb, and it kept me intrigued and curious until the very end. I am current on the entirety of Asur. It has an extraordinary flavour. This is a wonderful method to learn about the narrative and Indian mythology despite the slow places. It wasn't so terrible after all. After a lengthy absence, I eventually viewed an Urdu thriller film that held my attention until its conclusion. This time, Arshad Warsi joins Asur in front of the audience and his followers on the large screen. Fantastically written and skilfully executed film. Timing and cooperation between the actors in each scene are impeccable. Everyone involved laboured diligently to make it exceptional. Gaurav Shukla deserves special recognition for his outstanding written efforts. In addition to the excellent labour of Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. Presently awaiting my next assignment.\n",
      "Review 886: Alternatively, the actors, choreographer, and composer. This is something you ought to observe. I can't wait for the second season! After watching the entire season of this programme, I feel qualified to provide descriptive language. I can confidently assert that the performance is of the utmost calibre and quality because I personally witnessed it. It cannot simply be shown to Indians; a global audience is required. The founder and author, Gaurav Shukla, has accomplished a remarkable feat. Niren H. Bhatt and Vineet Chhawal were ably supervised by Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriya Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh. Your recollections of the performance will endure forever. I personally cannot wait for season two.\n",
      "Review 887: This is a mind-blowing series due to the narrative, acting, visuals, music, and particularly sound. Everyone from Arshad Warsi to Abhishek Chauhan to Rishad Dogra to Meiyang Chang to Amey Wagh to Pawan Chopra had their finest performance of their careers. This performance will secure the prise without question. This is the type of programme that makes us examine our own principles and assumptions. This programme has made a concerted effort to combine elements of science fiction and fantasy. Strongly recommended...be prepared to eagerly anticipate the third season. This mind-blowing suspense story will consume your every waking thought. It appears superior than the teaser implies. It has everything: mythology, psychology, forensics, a gorgeous score, and a fantastic plot. This should not be ignored.\n",
      "Review 888: The second season of Asur is a polished and tense drama. The performances of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobsi stand out in particular. The narrative is masterfully managed, maintaining suspense until the very end. In this programme, mythology and modern technology function well together. It is both intriguing and unsettling that the author uses ancient texts such as the Vedas to explain the killer's actions. The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil...Here are some of the series' advantages and disadvantages: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Several plot flaws. Some subpar visual effects.\n",
      "Review 889: Everyone involved laboured diligently to make it exceptional. Gaurav Shukla deserves special recognition for his outstanding written efforts. In addition to the excellent labour of Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. Presently awaiting my next assignment. After a prolonged absence, it was wonderful to see arsad warsi return on television. It's astounding to consider two parallel universes battling evil. Without even having seen the trailer, the synopsis convinced me to view the movie. Asur is more than just a straightforward criminal thriller about the pursuit of the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur by forensic experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti. Throughout the experience, it causes us to reflect on our principles, beliefs, and values, as well as the decisions we make under duress.\n",
      "Review 890: The storyline of Asur Season 2 is fascinating and complex. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti give outstanding performances. The story's pacing will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to conclusion. The show does a good job of blending mythology with science fiction. Intriguing and horrific, the killer's motivations are revealed in the Vedas and other ancient literature. The show also delves at the possible downsides of AI and how it may be utilised for evil. The pros and cons of the show are as follows: It blends mythology with technology; it features excellent acting; it has a well-paced tale; it features thrilling tension; and it provokes thought. There are a few holes in the story, and the visual effects are only okay.\n",
      "Review 891: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything in Asur is excellent, but the writing kept me puzzled and captivated until the very end. I have watched each episode of Asur. It is very impressive. It occasionally proceeds slowly, but this helps the reader comprehend the plot and Indian mythology. So I had no objections. After a lengthy absence, I watched an Urdu suspense that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears alongside Asur on a digital projection for the audience and his followers. The script and execution of this film are outstanding. Each performer has flawless action.\n",
      "Review 892: The performance of Asur cannot be summarised in a single phrase. It is easy to communicate profound emotions with a single, straightforward expression. Intelligent forensics expert turned family man, devoted father, and emotionally conflicted spouse. This was a fantastic novel of suspense. The plot holds your interest throughout the duration of the film. I appreciated the excellent work that Bickram Ghosh did with the background music. I experienced shivers during the final scene's BGM. I have just completed watching Asur. It is astounding how gorgeously mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research have been woven into the conception and implementation of this masterpiece; congratulations to the entire team, actors, and staff! I enjoyed each syllable!\n",
      "Review 893: Regarding effectiveness, Asur defies concise summarization. The quantity of emotion conveyed with a single gaze was astounding. He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely appreciated it.\n",
      "Review 894: Everyone involved did their utmost to make the event memorable. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to the next endeavour. The concept is brilliant. It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi on film again after a lengthy absence. Wonderful is the concept of two planets confronting an evil aspect. I viewed it without viewing the trailer due to the bio. Asur is more than just a criminal thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti pursue a self-proclaimed serial murderer, Asur. It compels us to reevaluate our principles, beliefs, and values at various points in our lives, as well as the decisions we make when confronted with.\n",
      "Review 895: The series is notable for its relative absence of crude humour and profanity. The time you put in with your loved ones is priceless. Give this show a solid seven or eight hours of your time. Last but not least, the directing and camerawork are excellent. Everything in the series functions as it should. The high ratings for Asur are well deserved. I may be suffering from an Asur hangover, but I still can't see a single flaw in this. The album opens and closes on foreboding tones. That is something I won't soon forget. I would rank this concert with the best of them. The script, the direction, the acting-everything was top-notch. Recently, I spent a whole day wandering about Asur. Never in a single day have I watched more than one Web series. Finally, an Eastern media production can compete intellectually with its Western analogues. We truly enjoy the great quality of this series.\n",
      "Review 896: Mr. Warsi, you've made an excellent point. The screenplay and direction are both excellent. Everyone performed an excellent job, given their specific roles. Asur, the finest Hindi web series to reconcile science and Hinduism, just broadcast its final episode. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the next episode. Wow, that's significant. This year, Asur will be unbeatable. For its excellent acting, direction, and writing, we award a perfect 10 to this web series. What have I done, God... Since all the episodes were released at once, I've decided to watch it this weekend. What occurred to me, I still can't believe. From where does Kali originate? When will this craziness finally end? The author's skill at creating suspense ensures that you won't be able to put the book down. I can only pray that the effort authors and publishers put in is reflected in the finished product.\n",
      "Review 897: It is occasionally a bit sluggish, but it aids comprehension of the narrative and Indian mythology. As a consequence, I was unconcerned. I eventually witnessed a riveting Hindi programme that endured to its conclusion after a lengthy wait. This time, Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur on a digital projection for the audience and supporters. Fantastic film with an excellent plot and execution. All of the performers' actions are perfectly timed. Everyone involved did their utmost to make the event memorable. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to the next endeavour.\n",
      "Review 898: Asur was unexpectedly the best web series in thriller/suspense and action genre, After sacred games I think I enjoyed this very much. It has very well written script and equally directed and executed by the actors. The background score was very good. If I have to compare it with Bollywood movies I think Bollywood A lister movies should learn to make a thriller from the makers of Asur. The plot is so gripping that you cant wait to stop after episode 1. Its an 8 episode story and the climax was so fulfilling even better than scared games season 1 and 2.\n",
      "Review 899: This is one of the best web series I have watched. Usually season 2 in Indian series are never better than season 1 in Indian series. But this is completely opposite in here. I liked season1 but season 2 is awesome. You need to watch season1 in order to understand season 2. But believe me you won't regret watching both the season. You cannot guess what is going to happen next, when you are watching the episodes. The series have really shown the true meaning of Asur(Demon) in modern world. This is so smartly and cleverly done. I usually don't write review unless its a very very good series. The series shows us how demons actually exists in our body. If I write more, this is not going to stop. Simply watch the series and enjoy.\n",
      "Review 900: A good story but lack of emotions, acting, and execution made it a good series but not a great series.\n",
      "Review 901: Very well written and edge of the seat thriller. Must watch\n",
      "Review 902: This genre of mythology-social villain-crime-drama is getting too much attention these days. Anyways, coming to this season 1 of Asur , it is brilliant in pieces with amount of thought process has gone into the writing, with atomic numbers or weight coming into the equation and better use of forensic knowledge coming to the fore (CID used Mr. Salunkhe and i am talking about that). overall, im baffled how a cute looking guy, turned out to be ugly later in life. there are too many plot holes of which you all might have found yourselves. But what this season lacked was someone of Gaitonde's status. Overall it is a good watch during the lockdown days.\n",
      "Review 903: Editing can be much better , little slow and not engaging screenplay, the story was good but far form reality.\n",
      "Review 904: Amazing performance from the whole team from actors to the backend.The way backstory to each character is told keeps you involved and intrigued till end and keep wanting moreThe story is absolutely different or at least is told and directed well enough, surely raises the current standards for indian web series, even though has full potential to be a full time series to be aired on satellite channelActing by all cast is so natural and effortless kudos to the casting team\n",
      "Review 905: Perfect blend of mythology and forensic science.. everything was top notch. It showed human dark side, selfish angle, and how person can influence by single damn mistake by others.If you really looking forward for high concept, engaging series, our country has finally made it.Path breaking, deserves appreciation.\n",
      "Review 906: No doubt it's the best Indian webseries till date and gripping story!!! Kudos to the performances especially Arshad warsi and ameta wagh!!! Do watch and I ensure you will not regret it.\n",
      "Review 907: Asur Undoubtedly Is Best Indian Mythological Thriller Series Which Perfectly Shows Both The Devil & God Inhibits In Human.\n",
      "Review 908: May be the best hindi series. Well directed, well executed, well written, well played.\n",
      "Review 909: Minor loops which impacted my thoughts of liking this series from a fan level to criticism level.\n",
      "Review 910: People in reviews are calling the ending weak , but i found the ending to be the best part of the show,great pace , character development ,and everything , direction could have been a bit better in a few scenes but apart from that i f you are reading this review go watch the show it's sooo damn good ,and i wish this was sacred games season 3 with Gaitonde in the show üòÇ\n",
      "Review 911: I could have given 10 but i think some of the key moments could have been acted better.....For me, an act is best when it comes from within and audience van tell you that........child artist (shubh)was brilliant so arshad and ridhi(nurshrat). Acting was not on the mark for the CBI head and riya (nikhil's daughter) .Nikhil was good but could do better .And this review is from very critical point of view but this will change small Ott platforms!.....-KANISHK SHARMA\n",
      "Review 912: This series will not allow to stop next episode and episodes. Must watch one of the great series all the time.\n",
      "Review 913: From.firrst scene to last scene can't blink eyes. Nail biting moments and till climex suspense . Amazing. Wow\n",
      "Review 914: OKAY-OKAY, BUT DEFINITELY NOT 8+Creating a mythological thriller is definitely a great concept, but it should be well-planned. Show begins with a great curiosity, but rapidly loses it it's charm in last few episodes ( especially in last episode. Too many things shuffled in a single episode ). Many instances are without any hint/explanation or based on mere assumptions. The makers do deserve an appreciation for thinking something new rather than those boring B'Wood drama but at same time strong criticism is also necessary for a flawed direction.\n",
      "Review 915: Arshad Warsi has again proved how brilliant actors he is. Varun Sobti is equally excellent in his part. A perfect thriller.. Cant stop raving at the screenplay & direction.I specially mention the special effect andstets all together making this serial alive.\n",
      "Review 916: Asur Is one of the great Indian series every launched.Full of mythology drama co-relating with today's world.\n",
      "Review 917: Asur Is awesome, I was hooked in the first 5 minutes, it's got great acting great story it's kept me guessing the whole time\n",
      "Review 918: It's bingeworthy. Perfect to watch during this lockdown.Concept is much different from other webseries.Best web series I ever watched.\n",
      "Review 919: Series is based to show dark side of a personality how a person is passionate about dead bodies ,and working secnerio of forensic science . Definitely it's very different concept.\n",
      "Review 920: Asur touched all the height to show the dark side of a person. Every murder scene and the CBI tracking is well coordinated. Each and every episode every every seen is well connected it not look like anything is entered here forcibly. Perfect serial to watch for all\n",
      "Review 921: In this Web Series We can Easily connect to each and every characters which has a huge effect on the Storyline of this Series. Here, We are able to understand each and every characters which creates high level of attraction towards this web series due to which many of us will watch it in 1 day.If you all watch this series then its my guarantee that you all won't feel bored even for a second due to its screenplay and the threatening mysterious background Music.#must_watch\n",
      "Review 922: This must be one of the best series I've seen lately. it's exciting from the first to the last episode,It's unpredictable, it's suspenseful, it's twisted, it's AMAZING!I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. Worth time spending on this show.\n",
      "Review 923: Asur is a Modern Villan it is one of the most unique and heart touching web series. I not only engage you till end also force you to think. Asur definitely raised the bar and viewer expectations for other online web series makers. Hats off to the whole team of Asur\n",
      "Review 924: Beautifully written and very well directed. This is one of the best Hindi web series I have come across in recent times. This series is at par with the western world series. The writing is so good that it kept me hooked and guessing till last and ofcourse I binge watched it in a single day. Everything is awesome for this series. Recommendation \"Yes\"\n",
      "Review 925: Mind boggling........A Masrepiece full of thrills and suspense.\n",
      "Review 926: Its really worth watching the series. Arshad rocks. Good to see Riddhi back. In Fact entire crew did a good job.\n",
      "Review 927: Probably the best web series in Indian entertainment history. . I never thought that they could make such a web series in India because of obvious reasons of being star focused industry. But it has made me feel amazed... probably in the top 10 of all time and all over.\n",
      "Review 928: There are a lot loop wholes.. But i enjoyed whole show except the last episode.. Which was not written good\n",
      "Review 929: I don't know why a well written script and a group of brilliant actors cannot make a perfect and practical shoe in India. This Show has many flaw, many times you realize the over hyped dialogues that goes nowhere. Lack of direction ofcourse and execution. It was literally fedding me up. Why this happened, why this not happened.\n",
      "Review 930: Brilliant Series in all aspect , a great example for new film-makers on how to make an intresting series should be in course curriculum of film schools .\n",
      "Review 931: This is one of the Best Web Series of Bollywood that I have ever saw.\n",
      "Review 932: Superb !!! Just watch it. So beautifully crafted !!!Each character is perfect in there each role.Direction is DOPEEEEEE\n",
      "Review 933: Onna the best I've watched till date!It has Drama, romance, action, talent, slang...one of the most inspiring series<3\n",
      "Review 934: After watching a few episodes, I can confidently tell that the show is outstanding. It must be viewed by people all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla and his writing team have done an excellent job. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. The tension in this series is palpable. You waste every second and minute worrying about the future. This is an excellent introduction to the insane character. My interest in the series was piqued immediately away. It's so amazing, and the story's concept is so exciting and intriguing, that I can't help but be captivated by the web series. This is an excellent online series that I like viewing and have suggested to several of my friends.\n",
      "Review 935: Yes, you are absolutely correct, Mr. Warsi. The premise is excellent, and it is effectively managed. The entire cast did an excellent job embodying their respective roles. Asur, the finest Hindi web series, combines Hindu spiritual concepts with scientific ones in a creative manner. I was absolutely captivated by the story, and I can't wait to read the next chapter. This year, Asur will receive every award that may be presented. A web series with the best acting, direction, and plot receives a flawless score of 10 out of 10. What I just did is incomprehensible to me. I'll give it a shot on the weekend, when all the episodes are released (conveniently, they were filmed on the weekend). Still bewildered by the unexpected... Explain Kali's identity to me in detail. How long does this continue? The greatest literature keeps its readers guessing until the very last page. Let's keep our palms crossed that the phases of production and publication do not take too long.\n",
      "Review 936: True level of Indian Web Series...Psycho killer concept is not new, but representation with Mythology is just unique.Superb Direction, Dialogues, Acting, Twist and Turns.Very powerful Villain.I fill like I got attach with Asur Guy with his background story\n",
      "Review 937: Asur is a #MustWatch Arshad Warsi superb performance I am in Love with you\n",
      "Review 938: Will recommend to watch Asur On Voot it's a brilliant show crime psychology thriller blend with mythology factor\n",
      "Review 939: by Asur On Voot perfect blend of hindu mythology and present crime drama .\n",
      "Review 940: I would like to recommend this to everyone . It is one of the best web series. It kept me glued to it from the beginning.The story is gripping ,acting is top class and every episode brings in more suspense and thrill\n",
      "Review 941: Must watch! Havent seen something this great in indian cinema in long.\n",
      "Review 942: Great series and just loved the way it twisted. Can't wait to witness the 2nd season\n",
      "Review 943: Terrific screenplay, exceptional performances. I was so hooked that I completed the whole series in 2 days.\n",
      "Review 944: I glued to my chair until the ending came.Its worthy of watching again and again\n",
      "Review 945: One of the best ever web series I have seen. What a beautiful story, what a great acting and what a great direction.I loved the plot and the story. How beautifully the story has been narrated taking the lines of slokas and mantras.I have stopped watching the stereo type stupid Netflix series. This is must watch.\n",
      "Review 946: Gave four stars for some good time pass moments and For Sharib Hashmi,Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti.Climax is a big let down no sense what is going on no logic on killings.You might guess the killers and conspirators on your own.The CBI officers start suspecting anyone randomly in thier own team which looks so half baked and illogical.No substantial explanation of murders and everything left so unfinished.I was glued to the show till last only because i heard good things about it but after finishing it I was left with nothing but only disappointment Voot has to invest more in production values Thier shows look so downgraded amd cheap.\n",
      "Review 947: Just one word mind blowing, super, outstanding one the best webseries waiting for 2 nd part.\n",
      "Review 948: This web series is so professionally crafted that it instantly draws viewers in with its complex plot. The outstanding narrative capacity of the series is demonstrated by its ability to link episodes and characterise a wide range of characters in a natural and consistent manner. The series is a sombre reminder of the far-reaching consequences of contemporary conflict. More shows like this one need to be made on the internet. I hope you'll take into account my desire that Season 3 production start as soon as possible. The script and acting are superb, and Arshad Warsi's charismatic portrayal as the protagonist gives the drama an air of mystery.\n",
      "Review 949: To begin with, It was a decent watch.I enjoyed how the references to Hindu mythology and philosophy had been woven into the narrative and the story-line. At some places, these references did feel out-of-context and forced but i am ready to overlook that as the overall experience wasn't bad.Also, it was nice how the characters had been given their own take on mythology and scriptures.Acting-wise, most of the characters did give a good performance but some could have been better.Particularly, the young Asur character didn't look intense enough. So, whenever the story-line would revisit the past and make references to his intensity, I would find something lacking.But overall I would say that it was a good watch and am ready to go with 7.\n",
      "Review 950: Season 2 of Asur is a well-made and dramatic drama. Both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti deliver exceptional performances. The narrative proceeds swiftly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series combines mythology and technology seamlessly. The use of the Vedas and other ancient texts to explain the killer's motives is both intriguing and disquieting. The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil...Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense*Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are subpar. Several plot flaws.\n",
      "Review 951: Amazing web-series ,absolutely love how the whole series is able to mix forensic science and mythology together.The series is set against the backdrop of the holy city of Varanasi which again is a great choice and goes well with the mythology element of the show.\n",
      "Review 952: Everyone involved worked hard to make it memorable. Special thanks to Gaurav Shukla for the outstanding writing he created. Also, congratulations to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire crew for their outstanding work. I'm now waiting for my next task. The concept is incredibly lovely. It was nice to see ArsadWarsi on TV again after such a long time. The notion of two universes and their battle against evil is incredible. I decided to see the film despite not having seen the trailer. Asur is more than just a crime thriller in which forensic experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti play a cat-and-mouse game in search of the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur. It makes us question our morals, beliefs, and values at various phases, as well as the judgements we make in severe and difficult situations.\n",
      "Review 953: Asur is an outstanding thriller. It is written brilliantly. Everything about this show is so good ,which is what kept me hooked till the end. It is a mind blowing thriller and a completely must watch. I recommend all the thriller lovers to watch it .\n",
      "Review 954: Because of the acting, planning, visuals, music, and, of course, the story, it's a mind-blowing series. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra all delivered outstanding performances. This series will surely take home the prise. It's the type of series that makes you rethink what is right or if what we think is right is indeed right after viewing it. This series has done an excellent job of fusing technology with folklore. I really advise you to see it, and yes, I am looking forwards to season 3. This is an incredible suspense thriller that will have you guessing the entire time. The trailer does not do the movie justice. Mythology, psychology, forensics, beautiful background music, and a fantastic story/screenplay. Don't miss out.\n",
      "Review 955: Asur's art defies concise explanation. Expressing complicated emotions with a single glance. Smart forensics specialist to loving father and husband to a scary Asur with whom he struggles emotionally. This gripping suspense thriller was fantastic. The writing holds the audience's attention throughout. Bickram Ghosh's soundtrack, which he created and played wonderfully, was one of my favourite sections of the film. The music for the final scene was terrifying. My most recent viewing was Asur. Congratulations to the whole crew, actors, and staff; the amount of research and the ease with which it was blended into the creation and execution of this masterpiece are genuinely impressive. Every single second was great!\n",
      "Review 956: After viewing the show, I can state unequivocally that it is of the highest calibre. It must be made available worldwide, not only in India. His authors' work, which included Gaurav Shukla, was excellent. The authors are Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. This show's suspense is always increasing. You are worried about what will happen every second and minute. A fantastic setting for a Psycho villain. My interest in this series was immediately piqued. The concept of the plot is intriguing and perplexing, adding a new element of mystery to an already captivating online series. I enjoy viewing this online series and have suggested it to many of my friends.\n",
      "Review 957: Previously, I regarded Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon to be the two best Indian web series available. Observing ASUR has persuaded me that it is the best Indian web series ever created. This is horrifying because it is grounded in reality and savagery; it is deserving of the title \"The Best.\" You will be captivated. This web series and Voot select have not been extensively promoted. However, take my word for it; this is an excellent example of Indian online content. I have never before extolled a film or web series with such fervour. Bollywood and Indian television's positive evolution is an encouraging trend. In our industry, talented actors and actresses have long been employed, but in recent years, filmmakers have placed a greater emphasis on narrative. Our writing has also improved in quality. Finally, a no-nonsense comparison....\n",
      "Review 958: And, in this high-tech, scientific world, where we are getting more alienated and lonely, are we becoming more prey to individuals who look lovely and rational but have their own agenda, to exert influence over you, ready to bend your thoughts and minds to their will.... A few adrenaline-fueled set pieces between dread of life and death generate a peculiar sense in the audience. The action is a series of scenes viewed together with the hero taking centre stage and hunting for bodies in exotic places, and the sceneries are magnificent. It creates excitement till the end and is generally great. Brilliantly written and executed! Thriller aficionados should not miss this! After watching the full season, I'd want to characterise this programme in a few terms. INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING SPELLBINDING INTRIGUING THOUGHT-PROVOKING SPELLBINDING.\n",
      "Review 959: I had only previously viewed Sacred Games (on Netflix) and Breathe (on Amazon) as Indian web series. As a result of Voot's selection of ASUR as India's finest web series ever, my perspective has changed. This is \"The Very Best,\" and you will be unable to stay seated. It is realistic, revolting, and horrifying. There are no large Voot select or Web series sales listed at this time. However, trust me when I say that it is a magnificent example of Indian web series and television at its finest. Never before have I given a film or web series such a glowing review. The improvement of Indian film and television is very encouraging. Incredible actors have always been a part of our industry, but contemporary directors are more focused on narrative. Likewise, the calibre of our stories is increasing. The word \"brilliant\" finally comes to mind.\n",
      "Review 960: Everyone gave their all to make the evening memorable. Gaurav Shukla, I admire your remarkable literary endeavour. Please also extend my best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the remaining crew members. I cannot wait to begin the following endeavour. This is a brilliant idea. It was great to see Arsad Warsi in a movie after such a lengthy absence. The concept of two planets uniting to combat a common adversary is fantastic. Even without a trailer, the bio convinced me to watch the film. The story written by Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti about two forensic experts on the search for the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur is more than a crime thriller. All of our objectives, beliefs, and values, as well as our response to adversity, are called into question.\n",
      "Review 961: First Mythological thriller in India. The way they present their story is just unbelievable. Bone chilling twist at the very end of every episode. Amazing ending which will force you to think. They have used Indian mythology very well to design the plot. I have one word only the \"Best\" web series of india.\n",
      "Review 962: After viewing a few episodes, I can say with certainty that the programme is excellent. It must be viewed by individuals worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla and his writing crew have performed admirably. The authors are Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. In this series, the tension is palpable. You spend each and every second and minute fretting about the future. This is a fantastic introduction to the psychotic character. My curiosity about the series was immediately piqued. The web series is so incredible and the story's premise is so thrilling and enthralling that I cannot help but be captivated by it. I enjoy watching this online series and have recommended it to several of my acquaintances.\n",
      "Review 963: Awesome concept and story adaptation .Acting is brilliant .The details on this each and every point seems so perfect.And keeps you on the edge of seat on each episode.\n",
      "Review 964: As enthralling as the first season, the second season of Asur is equally captivating. Both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti deliver outstanding performances. The rapid progression of the narrative will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The performance combines legend and modernity without difficulty. The killer's use of the Vedas and other ancient traditions to justify their actions is both fascinating and horrifying. It combines mythology and technology; it investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil; it has outstanding acting, a well-paced story, intense tension, and it will provoke thought. Numerous narrative holes exist, and the visual effects are not always remarkable.\n",
      "Review 965: Effectiveness of Asur is difficult to summarise in a few terms. The profundity of emotion conveyed by a single gaze is astounding. He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted spouse and father to his Scary Asur wife by night, with whom he has difficulty finding common ground. This was a truly spectacular performance. The script maintains the audience's interest throughout. One of my favourite aspects of the film was the music composed by Bickram Ghosh. The score at the conclusion of the film was unsettling. Asur is the most recent film I've seen. The team, performers, and personnel exerted extraordinary effort to incorporate mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I admired it very much.\n",
      "Review 966: After observing the performance, I can say unequivocally that it ranks among the finest I've ever witnessed. It should be viewed by everyone, not just Indians. Both the creator and authors share the same name, and both performed admirably. Authors are Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. Exciting episodes of an exciting television series. Even when you are dozing, you cannot stop pondering the future. The initial glimpse of Psycho was effective. After my first viewing, I was immediately captivated on this programme. It is remarkable, and the concept is enthralling and enigmatic, resulting in a captivating web series. I've been recommending this online series to everyone I know due to its high quality.\n",
      "Review 967: The absence of explicit sexual content and language is a defining characteristic of this series. The entire family can appreciate it. If you have seven to eight hours to view this series, you should do so. In addition, the acting and camerawork are both excellent. The entire series is faultless and immaculate. Asur's high ratings are well-deserved, as the programme is superb. This contains not a single error. A severe hangover from Asur has set in. The beginning and ending music is disconcerting. It has left an indelible mark on my psyche. In fact, it ranks among the best performances I've ever witnessed. I cannot stop extolling the plot, the direction, and the acting. A solitary day was sufficient to observe Asur. Prior to today, I had never watched an entire Web series in a single session. Finally, a comparable intelligence programme to the West. I appreciate your excellent performance.\n",
      "Review 968: This series examines the origins of evil, or asur, in the human psyche. Priorities shift as conditions evolve. What measures will your inner asur take to safeguard your safety? It is likely that others will not recognise the merit of your proposal. This tale of the macabre is incredibly well-written. There are a total of eight episodes, and each one becomes increasingly engaging. The entire production, from the plot to the acting, swept me away. The collective efforts of the group are very impressive. A must-see in every sense. What the what?! Suffices to resolve the issue. Wow, that's quite a number of items. Wow, this is a fantastic start for Voot choose. This type of American broadcast of an Indian television programme has never occurred before. Outstanding writing, direction, and performance. This combination of mystique and legend is breathtaking.\n",
      "Review 969: Or the Creatives (Writers, Directors, Actors, etc.). It is highly recommended that you devote some time to this. The upcoming second season is highly anticipated. After watching the full season, I feel well-equipped to write about this show. After seeing the event firsthand, I can say without hesitation that it was one of the best live performances I have ever seen, anywhere in the world. The movie should be released all across the world, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, inventor and writer, has done excellent work. In this concert by Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal, brilliantly directed by Oni Sen, you will see performances by Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh that you will never forget.\n",
      "Review 970: This Bollywood film has impressed me more than any other. Outstanding performances by all involved, particularly BARUN SOBTI, whom I revere. This is Arshad Warsi at his finest; I cannot wait for the second season. I cannot recall the last time I saw a web series of this calibre. I typically watch American web series, but this has piqued my interest in Bollywood films and television programmes. I hope the second season lives up to the lofty expectations set by the first. This post contains no spoilers, but I feel compelled to discuss one regardless. However, I will not do so here, as film is an art form in its own right. This series contains more than suspense. It provides intellectual stimulation. The plot develops smoothly, and the middle of the series will leave you eager for more. The term \"psychological thriller\" does not adequately describe the calibre of this programme..\n",
      "Review 971: And in this high-tech, scientific world where we're becoming more alienated and lonely, are we more likely to fall victim to those who appear pleasant and logical but are actually pursuing their own agenda, exercising control over you, and attempting to influence your ideas and thoughts? There are a few action sequences with high consequences that generate an unusual level of audience tension. The plot transpires in a series of thrilling sequences in which the protagonist plays a central role and conducts body searches in awe-inspiring locations that keep the audience on the edge of their seats to the very end. Both the composition and performance are exceptional. Fans of films with suspense should not miss this. After watching the entire season of this programme, I feel qualified to provide descriptive language. Incredible, astounding, mind-boggling, captivating, and thought-provoking.\n",
      "Review 972: This beautifully crafted web series immediately captivates its audience, bringing them deeply into the story's multiple levels. The seamless connection between episodes and the exceptional characterisation of numerous characters exemplify the series' exceptional storytelling ability. The series functions as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of modern warfare by depicting its lethal consequences. The film industry should produce a greater quantity of online programming of this calibre. Therefore, I respectfully request that Season 3 be concluded as quickly as possible. The language is excellent, and the main performance by Arshad Warsi lends the.\n",
      "Review 973: One of the series' distinguishing features is its lack of explicit language and vulgar stuff. Spending time with loved ones is always a good investment. Spend at least seven or eight hours on this series. Finally, the direction and camerawork are top-notch. The entire series works without a hitch. Asur is an excellent show that merits its huge viewership. Despite my Asur hangover, I can't find a single problem with this. The album begins and ends on ominous notes. I will never forget that now. This concert is up there with the greatest I've ever been to. The writing, directing, and acting were all excellent. The other day I devoted a full day to exploring Asur. I've never seen more than one Web series in a day. At last, a show that can hold its own intellectually against its western counterparts. The high standard of this series is really appreciated.\n",
      "Review 974: The second season of Asur is a lesson on how to gradually increase the stakes. Highlights include Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, but the entire cast is excellent. Exciting and mysterious, the plot keeps you wondering till the very end. The programme skilfully combines real science with fantastic elements. It's intriguing and unsettling how the author uses the Vedas and other ancient literature to get into the head of a serial killer. The episode also covers the negative aspects of AI. We'll be talking about the good and the bad of the show. Among the film's many merits is its \"excellent acting\" and the fact that it \"combines folklore with modern technologies.\"\n",
      "Review 975: The storyline is no dought awesome. These kind of stories really fascinates the audience who would love the thoughts showcased in it.\n",
      "Review 976: Mr. Warsi, you have nailed the nail on the head. It's a terrific plot that's also brilliantly directed. Congratulations to all of the characters for their outstanding performances. Asur, the best Hindi online series in terms of science and Hindu philosophy, just finished its run. I'm excited for the second installment. Excellent work, guy. Asur will win every prise this year. Because of its great acting, direction, and narrative, this web series deserves a flawless grade. What was I saying? What did they do over the weekend? I'm still not over it... What exactly is Kali's name? When is this going to end? Intelligent writing will keep you guessing about what will happen next. I can only hope that the time needed by artists and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 977: Before seeing this online series, I thought the best Indian web series were Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon. Voot has chosen ASUR, the best Indian internet series to date. \"The Very Best\" is a realistic, nasty, and disturbing picture. You are unable to quit from your jobs. There are no notable commercials for Voot Select or this web series. But believe me when I say it is one of the genuine jewels of Indian television and web series industry. I've never given such high marks to a film or web series. It's encouraging to see Indian movies and television getting better. Our profession has always produced outstanding performers, but directors are increasingly emphasising storyline. Our content's quality is also increasing. Finally, one word: remarkable...\n",
      "Review 978: The term asur, which means \"evil,\" refers to the origin of asur within the human body as the title of a new #voot series. The process through which one priority takes the place of another. The method by which your inner rage saves your life. Your point of view may be correct for some people but not for others. A beautifully crafted tale of despair. The tale is totally immersed in each of the eight episodes. The chat with the director, like the performances, is deafeningly silent. The totality of the team's efforts is incredible. Both must be considered and must not be overlooked. Oh my God, in three words! What an assortment! What a start for Vote Select! I've never seen anything like this before on Indian television. The writing, directing, and acting are all excellent. It's an excellent combination of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 979: Previously, I believed that Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon were the best Indian online series. ASUR has been selected by Voot as the best Indian web series ever produced. \"The Very Best\" is the best due to its realism, severity, and foreboding tone. You cannot escape your current positions. This online series and Vot choose do not feature any discernible commercial breaks. As far as Indian television and web series are concerned, it is one of the imperial assets. Never before have I written such an effusive review for a film or web series. There has been an obvious improvement in the calibre of Indian film and television. Recently, filmmakers have begun to place a greater emphasis on narrative, despite the fact that our industry has always had outstanding actors. Likewise, the quality of our writing is improving. In a nutshell, it was utterly remarkable.\n",
      "Review 980: Certainly not the best thriller I have seen.Proper intricate research and loose loophole ridden writing in parts.The first 2 episodes were brilliant but the script let it down after that.The climax doesn't make you want more of it.A dead end of a series.\n",
      "Review 981: As a series name, \"asur\" refers to the emergence of evil within the human psyche. The reorganisation of priorities. How far your inner asur will go to defend you. It is possible that your concept only applies to you and not to others. A tale of despair that is masterfully crafted. There are a total of eight episodes, and each one delves deeply into the story. I was amazed by everything, from the plot to the performances. The collective labour of the group is truly astounding. It must absolutely be seen. Holy smokes!! Is all that is necessary. Is this not a lengthy series? What an excellent beginning for Voot choose! This type of Indian television programme has never been broadcast in the United States. The script, direction, and performances were all outstanding. It is a wonderful blend of mystery and folklore.\n",
      "Review 982: This masterfully constructed web series effortlessly captivates its audience, drawing them into the story's intricate complexities. The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is demonstrated by the exceptional characterisation of multiple characters and the continuity between episodes. By exposing the destructive effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry must produce more web series with such high-quality screenplays. Therefore, I advise the creators to begin Season 3 production as soon as possible. The intriguing portrayal of the main character by Arshad Warsi adds to the series' perplexing nature, and the writing is excellent.\n",
      "Review 983: Arshad Warsi, you nailed it. It has a brilliant plot and is expertly executed. All of the characters played their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy.Outstanding effort, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! This year, every award will go to Asur. In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end? Clever writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the amount of time taken by creators and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 984: Asur 2 is an episode-by-episode mythological thriller with incredible developments. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team are routinely duped by a recurring gang of swindle artists. Arshad Warsi has done the character justice, who is so ingeniously crafted. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh share a similar situation. The premise of the show is perfectly adapted to the underlying principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the combination of legendary tales. Other members of the Starcast have also performed admirably, but certain passages are so lengthy as to be superfluous and extend the narrative until episode eight. If the editing had been precise, six episodes would have been sufficient for this programme. Hacking Sequences is a 30-minute brief episode in which Anupriya Gokhale implements algorithms created by nerds for geeks.\n",
      "Review 985: After viewing the performance, can confidently assert that it is among the finest in the world. It should be shown not only to Indian audiences, but to the entire globe. Both the creator and the writers, both named Gaurav Shukla, did an excellent job. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The Thrilling and Thrilling series. Every waking moment, you fret about the future. The character of Psycho was introduced effectively. When I first saw this series, I was immediately captivated. It's wonderful, and the concept is both intriguing and perplexing, making for an intriguing web series. I've been telling all of my peers about this web series due to its high quality.\n",
      "Review 986: Instead, it's the actors, filmmakers, and singers. It is unquestionably worthwhile to see. I can't wait for Season 2 to begin. After watching the entire season, I have some opinions to give regarding this show. I can say unequivocally that the programming is of the highest class and level; it is intriguing, thought-provoking, fantastic, mind-blowing, and captivating. It must be made available worldwide, not only in India. His authors' work, which included Gaurav Shukla, was excellent. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen are both good directors. All of the actors perform admirably, from Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti to Ridhi Dogra and Anupria Goenka to Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh. Seeing the concert in person will leave an indelible impression. I can't wait for Season 2 to begin.\n",
      "Review 987: Rajpoot and his coworkers keep falling for the same plot. Arshad Warsi performed the writing justice, which is to his credit. Amey wagh and Varun Arora are both included in this. The legendary story it tells is a great fit with the show's premise (using AI to anticipate and assess human behaviours). Other Starcast members have also done a great job, however the plot drags on for too long owing to overly wordy descriptions. The show could have had six installments if the editing had been tighter. Anupriya Gokhale's 30-minute \"hacking sequences\" episode will see her using algorithms developed by computer scientists just for fans of the genre.\n",
      "Review 988: I started watching because heard lot of praise about the show. I was quite pleased that every episode is on avg 40 mins long. on good part story is nice and keeps you gripped but towards the end it goes typical bollywood style film, lot of loop holes. Also being a software engineer i can not see ppl hack system like a piece of cake. Story is like a rollercoaster ride in terms of logic and smartness, most of the times you are like, \"wow!\" And some times, \"really!\".Most important part of thriller/suspense story is how shocking the end is, it was bit predictable towards end. But nice 1 time watch, 10 times better than sacread games season 2. Not as neat, perfect family man or mirapur\n",

By interspersing action passages with tense, horrifying pauses, an exotic atmosphere can be created. The protagonist spends the majority of screen time investigating horrific homicides in exotic locales with breathtaking vistas. Excellent strategy expertly implemented. Absolutely essentialviewing for genre enthusiasts. Having watched the entire season, I can confidently describe this programme. OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY PHENOMENAL.\n",

A few high-stakes action moments in the gap between life and death leave the spectator feeling uneasy. The action unfolds in a series of sequences that are all viewed at the same time, with the hero in the limelight as he investigates horrible deaths in aesthetically spectacular and exotic locations. Excellent work; amazing writing. A must-see for all Thriller fans! After viewing the entire season, I believe I am qualified to provide a concise description of this series. THOUGHT-PROVOKING AND SPELLBINDINGLY MAGICALLY INTERESTING.\n",

      "Review 1050: There are some flaws in this but you have to see this. This ia one of the best of indian web series content\n",
      "Review 1051: Asur is the analysis of the film made by one person or collectively expressing the opinion on the movie. ... The reviewer should explain how the story builds without recollecting key moments and ending.\n",
      "Review 1052: To make it a night to remember, everyone gave 100% of their efforts. Gaurav Shukla, I adore your creative writing. On top of that, I'd appreciate it if you'd share my warmest regards with Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I can't wait to dive into the next project. Absolutely brilliant! It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi in a movie again after such a long absence. It's incredible to think that two planets may work together to battle a shared foe. Without even watching a trailer, the bio alone had me sold. More than merely a crime thriller, the tale of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, two forensic scientists on the trail of the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur, is compelling. When we meet hardship, our principles, beliefs, and values, as well as our behaviours, are all put to the test.\n",

      "Review 1054: The performance of Asur cannot be summarised in a single phrase. It is easy to communicate profound emotions with a single,straightforward expression. Intelligent forensics expert turned family man, devoted father, and emotionally conflicted spouse. This was a fantastic novel of suspense.The plot holds your interest throughout the duration of the film. I appreciated the excellent work that Bickram Ghosh did with the background music. I experiencedshivers during the final scene's BGM. I have just completed watching Asur. It is astounding how gorgeously mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research have been woven into the conception and implementation of this masterpiece; congratulations to the entire team, actors, and staff! I enjoyed each syllable.\n",

Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment. The concept is extremely beautiful. It was great to see Arsad Warsi on television again after so long. Incredible is the concept of two universes and their struggle against evil. I chose to watch the movie despite not having seen the trailer. Asur is more than a straightforward crime thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a cat-and-mouse game in quest of the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur. It causes us to doubt our morals, beliefs, and values at various junctures, as well as the decisions we make in extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 1057: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to individuals who appear cordial and reasonable but are actually pursuing their own agenda, wielding control over you, andprepared to corrupt your thoughts and ideas? A few life-or-death action situations generate unusual tension among the audience. The hero takes centre stage and conducts body searches in exotic locales, and the scenery is so breathtaking that it generates tension until the very end and is excellent overall.Outstandingly competent writing and performance! A must-see for fans of suspense! After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. INTRIGUING THINK-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING BEWITCHING.\n",
      "Review 1058: As the title of a new #voot series, the term asur, which means \"evil,\" refers to the origin of asur within the human body. The manner in which one priority replaces another. The manner in which your inner fury saves your life. Your viewpoint may be correct for some individuals but not for others. An exceptionally well-written tale of melancholy. Each of the eight episodes completely immerses the audience in the storyline. As with the performances, the conversation with the director is mute. The sum of the team's efforts is astounding. Both must and must not be ignored. Three words: oh my God! What a collection! What a beginning for Vote Select! I've never seen anything like this on Indian television before. The script, direction, and acting are all outstanding. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 1059: This beautifully crafted web series immediately captivates its audience, bringing them deeply into the story's multiple levels. The seamless connection between episodes and the exceptional characterisation of numerous characters exemplify the series' exceptional storytelling ability. The series functions as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of modern warfare by depicting its lethal consequences. The film industry should produce a greater quantity of online programming of this calibre. Therefore, I respectfully request that Season 3 be concluded as quickly as possible. The language is excellent, and the main performance by Arshad Warsi lends the series a compelling character.\n",
      "Review 1060: This is one of the best Bollywood films I've ever seen. Arshad Warsi's performance in BARUN SOBTI is the best I've ever seen, and I eagerly anticipate the second season. I haven't seen a better online series in quite some time. I enjoy watching Hollywood web series, but this has piqued my curiosity about Bollywood content. I hope the second season surpasses the first. This article contains no spoilers, but I am compelled to reveal one. However, I will not because the film is an artistic creation. This series is more than just a suspense. It stimulates mental activity. The story advances effectively, and the conclusion leaves you wanting more! This programme is a \"psychological thriller\" in the finest sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 1061: GOOD STORY BUT SOME FLAWS , BUT ONE TIME WATCH IT LOOKS GREAT IN SOME PARTS AND SOME TIMES IT LOOKS WORST.AVG SERIES.\n",
      "Review 1062: One of the best Bollywood flicks I've ever seen. Amazing acting abilities My own preference DR. BARUN SOBTI This has been the best web series I have watched in a while I am a Hollywood web series lover but this has made me eager for Bollywood content also hope the next season must come up with the same perfection and excellence this must get a lot of awards thanks to all the team for this and once again waiting for season 2. This doesn't include any spoilers, although I'm tempted to tell you one, but I'm resisting, so please watch it; it's a masterpiece. This is much more than a thriller. It deceives your mind. At the midway point of the series, the narrative builds wonderfully and leaves you wanting more! This show is a \"psychological thriller\" in the true sense of the phrase.\n",
      "Review 1063: While Asur is without defect, I was completely lost while reading it. The totality of Asur is up to date in my knowledge. It stands out in a significant way. Even while learning Indian mythology might be tiresome at times, it's definitely worth your time. That's why I wasn't bothered by it in the slightest. I was finally able to see an engaging Hindi drama after a very long wait. For the sake of his fans, Arshad Warsi, who has played Asur before, is reprising the role. The script and production of this picture are both quite impressive. The timing of all the performers is impeccable. Each participant made significant efforts to make this event one to remember. We appreciate your wonderful literary work, Gaurav Shukla. As a group, we'd want to extend our best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the squad. What happens next has my eager anticipation.\n",
      "Review 1064: And in this high-tech, scientific world where we're getting more alienated and lonely, are we more inclined to fall prey to people who look nice and rational but are, in fact, following their own agenda, exerting control over you, and seeking to influence your views and thoughts? There are a few action scenes with very high stakes, and the audience reacts with exceptional anxiety. The story unfolds in a succession of nail-biting scenes in which the protagonist plays a pivotal role and performs body searches in breathtaking settings that will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The music and the acting are both superb. Do not miss this if you enjoy flicks with a high level of tension. After viewing the full season, I feel I can adequately describe this show. Amazing, incredible, mind-boggling, fascinating, and stimulating to think about.\n",
      "Review 1065: Everyone involved did everything they could to make it memorable. Thank you for this great work of literary art, Gaurav Shukla. Congratulations to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team as well. I'm excited about the next project. The concept is fantastic. After a long time, it was great to see Arsad Warsi on film again. The concept of two worlds battling an evil side is wonderful. Because of the bio, I watched it without watching the trailer. Asur is more than just a crime thriller in which forensic experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti play a cat-and-mouse game in pursuit of Asur, a self-proclaimed serial killer. It forces us to reconsider our principles, beliefs, and values at various points in our lives, as well as the decisions we make when confronted with extreme and difficult events.\n",
      "Review 1066: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to those who appear pleasant and sensible but have their own agenda, ready to exert control over your thoughts and minds? A few moments of high-stakes action in the space between life and death unnerve the viewer. The action transpires in a series of simultaneous sequences, with the protagonist in the spotlight as he investigates gruesome murders in aesthetically stunning and exotic locales. Outstanding achievement; remarkable writing. A must-see for all aficionados of Thriller! After watching the entire season, I feel qualified to provide a concise summary of this television series. THOUGHT-PROVOKING AND MAGICALLY CAPTIVATINGLY INTERESTING.\n",
      "Review 1067: After viewing the performance, I can confidently assert that it is among the finest in the world. It should be shown not only to Indian audiences, but to the entire globe. Both the creator and the writers, both named Gaurav Shukla, did an excellent job. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The Thrilling and Thrilling series. Every waking moment, you fret about the future. The character of Psycho was introduced effectively. When I first saw this series, I was immediately captivated. It's wonderful, and the concept is both intriguing and perplexing, making for an intriguing web series. I've been telling all of my peers about this web series due to its high quality.\n",
      "Review 1068: This web series was obviously created with great care, as its intricate narrative easily attracts viewers. The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is on display in the evocative depiction of various characters and the episode-to-episode continuity. The show's depiction of technological warfare's devastation serves as a sobering reminder of the far-reaching consequences of such conflict. In the film industry, more scripts of this calibre should be used to produce web series. Therefore, I implore the producers to expedite Season 3 production. In addition to the outstanding language, Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance as the protagonist is a significant contributor to the show's mysterious atmosphere.\n",
      "Review 1069: Instead, the names of the artists who really did the work are acknowledged. Keeping an eye on this is a must. I eagerly await the premiere of the upcoming season. After finishing the season, I have some observations to make about this show. Without a doubt, the programme is of the highest quality and calibre; it is captivating, thought-provoking, stunning, mind-boggling, and mesmerising on every level. Not only in India, but globally, this has to be shared. Gaurav Shukla was one of the many talented authors who contributed to his book. Captaining-wise, both Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen are quite effective. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh, among others, all give outstanding performances. Experiencing the show live will leave you with unforgettable memories. I eagerly await the premiere of the upcoming season.\n",
      "Review 1070: When you take into account the series' acting, story, narrative, visuals, soundtrack, and tale, you'll agree that it's fantastic. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riddhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, Pawan Chopra, and the rest of the cast all gave excellent performances. This show deserves the honour without a doubt. It's the kind of show that remains with you and makes you wonder if you've been living by the right set of ideals all these time. This show has gone well beyond the call of duty to include fantastical aspects. I really recommend it, and I can confirm that I cannot wait for the third season. This page-turning thriller will have you thinking long after you've finished it. The film is better than the trailer suggests. A comprehensive script including everything from folklore to criminological theory to a musical soundtrack fit for a film. Do not waste this chance.\n",
      "Review 1071: Before viewing this online series, I believed that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon were the finest Indian web series. Voot has selected ASUR, which is the finest Indian online series to date. The film \"The Very Best\" is realistic, brutal, and terrifying. You cannot resign from your respective positions. There are no noteworthy advertisements for Voot Select or this web series. But trust me when I say that it is one of the Jewels, unadulterated Gold, of Indian television and web series culture. I have never rated a film or web series so highly. It is gratifying to observe the improvement of Indian film and television. Our industry has always had exceptional actors, but filmmakers are also putting more emphasis on plot. The quality of our content is also improving. One final word:\n",
      "Review 1072: Season 2 of Asur is a well-made and dramatic drama. Both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti deliver exceptional performances. The narrative proceeds swiftly and maintains suspense until theconclusion. The series combinesmythology and technology seamlessly. The use of the Vedas and other ancient texts to explain the killer's motives is both intriguing and disquieting. The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil...Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: *Outstandingperformances \"Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are.\n",

As a group, we'd want to extend our best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the squad. What happens next has my eager anticipation. This is a brilliant idea. It was great to see Arsad Warsi return in theatres after such a long gap. The idea of pitting two kingdoms against one awful power is ingenious. The summary was enough to convince me to see the movie without first watching the trailer. More than merely a crime thriller, the plot follows forensics professionals Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti as they try to track down the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur. Our morals, ethics, and values are tested, as are our coping mechanisms for difficult situations.\n",
      "Review 1074: Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced.

      "Review 1075: Everyone hoped that it would be something genuinely amazing. We owe a debt of gratitude to Gaurav Shukla for his insightful and well-written contribution. I'd like to thank Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and everyone else in the fantastic team. My upcoming responsibilities have not been determined. The concept is beautiful. It was great to see Arsad Warsi in a film again after what seemed like an aeon. It blows my mind that beings from different universes can band together to vanquish evil. Without the trailer, I still would have seen this film in a cinema. In Asur, we accompany two forensics experts, Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, as they track down a serial killer. This is not your average suspense novel. It makes us reflect on our own moral compass and the gravity of our decisions under pressure.\n",
      "Review 1076: This web series has such outstanding production standards that its viewers are instantly drawn in. The amazing storyline is supported by a cast that is both varied and consistent from episode to episode. The series' devastating depiction of modern warfare's repercussions is meant to serve as a grim reminder of this reality. The film industry would benefit greatly from more online-only series like this. Season 3 of this programme has to be released as soon as humanly feasible. Arshad Warsi's mesmerising acting is a major reason why the show's main character is so interesting and why the conversation works so well.\n",
      "Review 1077: Previously, I believed that the initial seasons of Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon were the finest Indian web series. However, after viewing ASUR, I have completely changed my mind and now consider it the greatest Indian web series to date. It is unsettling because it is predicated on truth and severity, and it is truly \"The Best.\" This will stimulate your interest. Both Voot choose and this web series have received little attention. But trust me when I say that this is one of the Golden Nuggets of Indian television and web series. Never before have I been so excited about a movie or web series. It is encouraging to observe the improvement of Bollywood and Indian television. In the past, our industry has been known for its excentional actors but in recent years.\n",

Outstandingly competent writing and performance! A must-see for.\n",
      "Review 1079: Asur's performance cannot be summed up in a single statement. It is simple to express deep feelings with a single, clear statement. Intelligent forensics specialist who has become a caring parent and emotionally tormented husband. This was an excellent suspense thriller. The narrative keeps your attention for the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh performed a wonderful job with the background music, which I loved. During the closing scene's BGM, I got shivers. I just finished watching Asur. It's incredible how well mythology, astrology, science, and psychology study have been integrated into the creation and execution of this masterwork; congrats to the whole crew, performers, and staff! I relished every phrase!\n",
      "Review 1080: The second season of Asur is a captivating and intricate narrative. The performances of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti are particularly impressive. The story is fast-paced and keeps you on the verge of your seat until the very end. The programme successfully combines mythological and science fiction elements. According to the Vedas and other ancient texts, the killer's motives are both intriguing and horrifying. The series also investigates the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and how it may be used for evil. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of the programme: Pros: *Excellent acting *Well-paced story *Thrilling tension *Thought-provoking It integrates mythology and technology. The plot contains a few inconsistencies, and the visual effects are average.\n",
      "Review 1081: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are growing more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more vulnerable to people who look friendly and reasonable but are actually following their own agenda, exercising power over you, and ready to corrupt your views and ideas? A few life-or-death action scenes create unusually high levels of suspense in the audience. The hero takes central stage and performs body searches in exotic locations, and the landscape is stunning, generating excitement till the very end and being outstanding overall. Outstanding writing and acting skills! A must-see for suspense aficionados! After watching the full season, I'd want to use a few words to define the show. THINK-PROVOKING INTRIGUING MIND-BLOWING BEWITCHING.\n",
      "Review 1082: After witnessing the performance, I can confidently state that it is of the greatest grade and quality. It must be shown to audiences all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, the inventor and author, has done an excellent job. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal are the authors. Throughout the series, suspense reigns supreme. Every minute and second, you agonise about the future. Excellent description of the Psycho persona. When I first saw this series, I was immediately taken to it. It's genuinely mind-boggling, and the notion of the plot is both exciting and baffling, adding to the web series' allure. I routinely promote this fantastic web series to my colleagues, and I also love watching it.\n",
      "Review 1083: This series is distinguished by its lack of immorality and foul language. It is appropriate for family entertainment. This course will not disappoint if you devote 7-8 hours to it. Moreover, theperformances and cinematography are also exceptional. There is not a single flaw in the series. Asur is not only a popular series, but it also merits its popularity. This contains no flaws; everything is ideal. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. Beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It has become ingrained in my mind. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot resist praising the screenplay, direction, and acting. I watched Asur in a single day. I have never before completed a Web series in a single day. Finally, a programme with Western intelligence. Thank you for creating such an outstanding series.\n",
      "Review 1084: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDINGINTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKINGINCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The concert will forever remain in your memory. I eagerly anticipate the second season.\n",
      "Review 1085: Asur's performance defies succinct summation. Directly expressing complex emotions is surprisingly simple. Recently married forensics expert who experiences emotional ups and downs with his tough Asur wife, despite their clear mental compatibility. The entire story was infused with a distinct air of foreboding. The script does a great job of holding your interest throughout the entire film. I thought Bickram Ghosh did an excellent job composing the music. The music in the final moment was quite foreboding. The most recent film I've seen is Asur. I want to congratulate the whole cast and crew on this fantastic production, which so expertly combines elements from mythology, astrology, science, and psychology. We value your feedback greatly.\n",
      "Review 1086: As a witness, I can speak to the fact that the performance was superb. It's important that it be viewed all around the world, not only in India. Creator/author Gaurav Shukla has done incredible work. It was developed via the combined efforts of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. There are several tense moments throughout the series. As time passes, you can't help but wonder what will happen next. The best method for learning Psycho. The moment I came onto this programme, I was hooked. Part of what makes this web series so interesting is its original and compelling story. I've really loved watching and recommending this web series to my friends.\n",
      "Review 1087: The writers, directors, and actors should also be credited. It would be a shame to miss this performance. My interest was piqued by Season 2. Now that I've seen the full season, I can sum up this TV show accurately. After watching the show, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the greatest possible standard and quality. It captivates, prompts reflection, astounds, and boggles the mind. People all throughout the world, not only in India, need to see it. The work of Gaurav Shukla and his team of writers is outstanding. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen do an outstanding job at the helm. Everyone from Arshad Warsi to Barun Sobti to Ridhi Dogra to Anupria Goenka to Sharib Hashmi to Gaurav Arora to Amey Wagh gives a stellar performance. Many people will be deeply affected by the show. I can't wait for Season 2 to start.\n",
      "Review 1088: People who have zero knowledge on mythology and astrology or should I say don't believe in them won't like this show, it's as simple as that.If only the ending would have been apt, would have rated 10/10.Story - 10/10Casting - 6/10Acting - 8/10Hopefully they will make up for the climax in the coming season\n",
      "Review 1089: I think most of the people have already mentioned about the series. I would just like to request Voot to increase the budget for this series in the next season as lpw budget was quite evident. The other thing where i felt let down was the background score which wasn't gripping for a series which was written so good. The cinematography and the direction needs to change to be at par with other top series. I was disappointed with the cast and the lead actor, just felt that should have had better actors especially the lead actor. Hopefully, these things will be implemented in the series.\n",
      "Review 1090: A dark world combined with Indian mythology fables and modern heinous crime realm showcases the dark side of each individual successfully created on the screen by captivative screenwriting and amazing direction. It is a Spine-chilling, gritty and enthralling web series which truly stand out amongst the best international thrillers. Completely hooked from the beginning till the last. Never expected such a promising series from voot select, which will sas a new potential platform to offer some binge worthy series for its indian viewers. tremendous job done by the creators and actors. It was great to watch Arshad Warsi in a promising role after Seher and Munnabhai mbbs. Best series of 2020.\n",
      "Review 1091: Asur is a wonderful concept, something that hasn't been hitherto seen in India. The story is taut and doesn't drag even for a moment, despite some holes in the plot. Great direction, as it build up the tempo nicely throughout the series.I feel the last episode could have been better. That is where is just slips a little and it feels as if the director wasn't sure on how to end it. But it is a very good attempt and hope to see more from this team.\n",
      "Review 1092: Good series with too many loopholes and lack of detailing...it should be of 5 episode...they stretched it too much...concept was unique but execution was not great....the series could be better...main problem is casting....all the people act really bad in the series\n",

      "Review 1095: This is a gem of pure class. From all the movies and web shows that I have ever watched, this one from Oni Sen is total crazy. I used to watch True detective alot, but after this I can say that am going to stick to it for a long long time. And bollywood is going to learn hugely from this. Respect for the director, as direction is absolutely awesome. The music is haunting and reminisces about everything crime. The writing is the backbone of this show as it takes you through the scenes in a way that you will just dive deeper and deeper with every second of it. the characters are witten and staged very very well. A thunderous tribute to the makers of Asur.\n",

      "Review 1113: When I started watching this I found it really interesting but when the plot moved further I found some similar connection to Sacred Games, only story set up was different. It moves around the same Religious psychopath and creation of myth of good and bad and justification of it. Story should have been much better but I really liked the acting of the characters. This series only try to explore the dark things and shows the surrender of truth citing some irrelevant and illogical examples. Really it was an urban 'Sacred Games'.\n",

The answer is Asur, as it does have poltholes here and there if you watch carefully.This drama also teaches u how ur \"right\" decision could end up being a wrong decision even though the decisions sets in to the required parameters perfectly.The end makes u think, terrorism by Christianity and Islam are already a thing.

      "Review 1184: This show is much more than just an entertaining espionage thriller - but a portrait of reality on the ground. I am not talking about technical reality, but the reality of situations - how there is a certain truth to both sides of the coin. This show will not try to influence you to sympathize with any one of the sides, or most importantly, not try to present another one of those dramatic saga of over the top heroism. Instead, it deals with the thin line between the obvious black and white - the gray area that many of us overlook. This is a very beautifully weaved story\n",

      "Review 1193: While this web series is better than a typical hindi tv serial, the script is weak in many places. Dialogues are average. Arshad has acted well but many others struggle especially the person playing role of Nikhil is unimpressive. If you are looking for a great thriller you might as well skip it. Plenty of places with illogical scenes. Good thing is that you can watch it with your family.While this web series is better than a typical hindi tv serial, the script is weak in many places.

      "Review 1196: This is one of the best series ever seen in India after Forgotten army, sacred games, mirzapur.The story holds you through the journey, and you are not even able to predict whats next to be happening. Each episode is having its own catch.Well done, keep the same.\n",
      "Review 1197: NO abusive language, nudity, unnecessary exploitation of Hindu religion and it's mythology, Asur sets an example amidst all the series which have every other dialogue being abusive and every alternate scene either showing too much violence or nudity. It makes a statement that you can make a must watch series without all those things.. Everything is good, screenplay, direction, use of background music and ofcourse cast who have presented it so well. It makes you think, go deep and even question yourself as to how far will you go to save your loved ones and how a childs' psychology is shaped on basis of what he hears and is always being hammered up on, how his upbringing plays role in what he has now become an ASUR. Though the plotline may seem similar to that of many others in beginning but after watching you realise it's way too different and Yes there are certain loopholes but then it's a lot better than others in the same genre.\n",
      "Review 1198: Not to mention the musicians, filmmakers, and performers. The show is certainly worth seeing. Season 2 has piqued my interest. After viewing the entire season, I believe I am qualified to provide a concise description of this series. After seeing the programme, I can confidently claim that it is first-rate and world-class. It's fascinating, thought-provoking, astounding, mind-boggling, and enthralling. It must be viewed by people all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla and his writing team have done an excellent job. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen's direction is amazing. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh all provide stellar performances. Viewers are deeply moved by the show. Season 2 is something I'm looking forwards to.\n",
      "Review 1199: The performers, script, aesthetics, soundtrack, and story all contribute to this being an excellent production. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra were all excellent performers. This concert is a guaranteed thing. It's the kind of show that remains with you, making you wonder what's right and whether our own criteria of right are realistic. This programme has come a long way in integrating the mythic and modern worlds. I strongly suggest it...you should definitely watch it, and season 3 has me extremely eager. This incredible suspense thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The trailer does not do the film credit. An wonderful narrative and script combining mythology, psychology, forensics, and incredible music. Do not pass up this opportunity.\n",

      "Review 1201: This series stands out from others in part because of the lack of vulgarity and foul language. Involve everyone in the family if you like. You should set up seven or eight hours to see the entire series. Finally, the cinematography and acting are both of the highest calibre. There is not a single weak point in the entire series. Asur deserves his high popularity ratings. There is not a single vulnerable area. I now have a full-blown Asur hangover. The score in the beginning and end is really ominous. My mind can't stop replaying it. Honestly, I can say that it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to. I enjoyed every aspect of the film, from the writing to the direction to the acting. In a single sitting, I read all of Asur. I've never watched a whole Web series in one sitting before today. Finally, a clever programme that can compete with the West. Please accept my sincere appreciation for putting on such a wonderful performance.\n",

I always recommend this fantastic web series to my friends, and I also love watching it.\n",
      "Review 1226: The legendary stories in each episode of Asur 2 are magnificent. The same evil person who has been fooling Dhanjay Rajpoot and his company for a long time now is at it again. Arshad Warsi, the author, does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the protagonist. Varun Arora's and Amey Wagh's predicaments are very similar. The show's plot and its central theme (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) are a wonderful match. However, the tale was dragged out until episode 8 by superfluous sequences, despite the excellent performances of the remaining cast members. A successful run of six seasons is possible if the programmes are edited more tightly. A thirty minute episode of Hacking may be cobbled together from several Goneka-centric sequences in which Anupriya Goneka performs (for enjoyment) programmes developed by programmers for geeks.\n",
      "Review 1227: After observing the performance, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the highest calibre and quality. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. Suspense prevails throughout the series. You agonise about the future every minute and second. Excellent summary of the Psycho character. I was instantly drawn to this series upon my initial exposure to it. It's truly mind-boggling, and the story's premise is both intriguing and perplexing, which adds to the web series' intrigue. I frequently recommend this excellent online series to my peers, and I also enjoy viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 1228: Among the greatest Bollywood movies I've ever watched, this is easily in the top three. All of the actors were fantastic, but DR. BARUN SOBTI was my personal fave. Even though I enjoy watching American web series, this has aroused my curiosity in Indian cinema and television. I look forwards to the next season with the same enthusiasm. This article does not include any spoilers, but I will mention one anyway since I feel required to do so. The tension in these works goes well beyond that. This is a mental trick. The story's halfway over, and it's already gotten so good that you can't wait for the next chapter. The label of \"psychological thriller\" is too mild for this programme.\n",
      "Review 1229: The show's grandeur comes from the quality of its writing, structure, visuals, music, and narrative, as well as the superb performances of the cast as a whole. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riddhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra have all contributed much to the field. Without a doubt, this programme merits the highest honours. Some of your preconceived notions may need to be revised in light of the data offered here. Attempts were attempted to combine mythology and science on this show. The importance of reading it cannot be overstated. Unbelievably tense moments that continue right up to the final page. The preview is not representative of the full film. The mythological, psychological, forensic, musical, and narrative elements in this film are all top-notch. Don't miss out on this fantastic opportunity.\n",
      "Review 1230: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ALL OF YOU..? WHY YOU ALWAYS COMPARE A STORY WITH PRACTICAL SITUATIONS..IS IT IMPORTANT TO FIND LOGIC IN EVERY SCENE.....IS THERE ANY LOGICS IN AVENGERS AND DC FILMS..IS THERE ANY LOGICS IN HOLLOYWOOD FILM AND SERIES...NO...THERE IS NO MOVIE IN THE WORLD WHICH CAN SATISFIED AN AUDIENCE COMPLETLEASUR IS A GOOD SERIES WHICH CAN ENGAGE AUDIENCES TILL THE END,IT HAS A GOOD STORY AND DIRECTION AND ACTING IS FINE.YES THERE MANY LOPEHOLES IN THE SERIES BUT IT CAN BE IGNORED DEPENDING UPON THE VIEWER...OVERALL ITS A NICE SERIES\n",
      "Review 1231: Arshad Warsi, your argument was persuasive. Both the plot and the way it's carried out are superb. Everyone who played a role performed a fantastic job. The Hindi web series Asur, which included prominent discussions between science and Hinduism, has concluded. The upcoming chapter has peaked my interest. You've truly topped your previous efforts. This year, Asur will win a hat trick of trophies. I've never seen a web series with better acting, directing, and writing than this one. I was simply mentioning... You can probably imagine what they did over the weekend when I was watching it if you wait till all the episodes are out. I still haven't fully recovered... Who, exactly, is Kali? For how much longer will this go on? You should always be curious what happens next in a well-written novel. I pray the authors and publishers don't have to wait too long.\n",
      "Review 1232: Among the finest Bollywood films ever made. SOBTI BARUN is exactly the kind of online series I've been looking for. One of my fave performers, Arshad Warsi, gave a spectacular performance in the first season, and I can't wait to see what he does next. I'm eager to see more Bollywood films now. Even though I normally prefer American television, I'm compelled to recommend this film to you because to its high artistic quality; I won't give anything away. There's more to it than just a fantastic narrative. This is fantastic for stimulating the mind. The show's storyline really begins to take off towards the hour-and-a-half mark. This show is perfect if you want to witness an excellent example of a psychological thriller.\n",
      "Review 1233: You have hit the target on the head, Mr. Warsi. It is a fantastic story that is also expertly directed. Congratulations to all of the characters, who all performed admirably. Asur, the finest Hindi web series in terms of science and Hindu philosophy. Recently concluded. I'm looking forwards to the second installment. Outstanding effort, gentleman. This year, Asur will obtain every prise. This web series receives a perfect score due to its excellent acting, direction, and storyline. What did I just say... Guess what they did over the weekend? I'm not over it yet... What precisely is Kali's identity? When will this be over? Intelligent writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the time required by artists and publishers is not.\n",
      "Review 1234: In the moment where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a character, there is an editing issue. Asur is fantastic in every way, but the writing in especially left me wondering till the very end. I've seen every episode of Asur. It's incredible. It's somewhat slow, but it helps with grasp of the story and Indian mythology. As a result, I was unconcerned. After a long wait, I finally saw a compelling Hindi programme that lasted to the finish. This time, Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur for the audience and supporters via a digital projection. Fantastic movie with a great plot and execution. The motions of the performers are all well synchronised. Everyone involved worked hard to make the occasion unforgettable. Gaurav Shukla, thank you for your amazing work of literary art. Congratulations to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team. I'm looking foward to the next adventure.\n",
      "Review 1235: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything in Asur is excellent, but the writing kept me puzzled and captivated until the very end. I have watched each episode of Asur. It is very impressive. It occasionally proceeds slowly, but this helps the reader comprehend the plot and Indian mythology. So I had no objections. After a lengthy absence, I watched an Urdu suspense that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears alongside Asur on a digital projection for the audience and his followers. The script and execution of this film are outstanding. Each performer has flawless action synchronisation. Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment.\n",
      "Review 1236: This is one of the best Bollywood filmsI've ever seen. Arshad Warsi's performance in BARUN SOBTI is the best I've ever seen, and I eagerly anticipate the second season. I haven't seen a better online series in quite some time. I enjoy watching Hollywood web series, but this has piqued my curiosity about Bollywood content. I hope the second seasonsurpasses the first. This article contains no spoilers, but I am compelled to reveal one. However, I will not because the film is an artistic creation. This series is more than just a suspense. It stimulates mental activity. The story advances effectively, and the conclusion leaves you wanting more! This programme is a \"psychological thriller\" in the finest sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 1237: .Season 2 of Asur is a well-made and dramatic drama. Both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti deliver exceptional performances. The narrative proceeds swiftly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series combines mythology and technology seamlessly. The use of the Vedas and other ancient texts to explain the killer's motives is both intriguing and disquieting. The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil... Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are subpar. Several plot flaws.\n",
      "Review 1238: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to individuals who appear cordial and reasonable but are actually pursuing their own agenda, wielding control over you, and prepared to corrupt your thoughts and ideas? A fewlife-or-death action situations generate unusual tension among the audience. The hero takes centre stage and conducts body searches in exotic locales, and the scenery is so breathtaking that it generates tension until the very end and is excellent overall. Outstandingly competent writing and performance! A must-see for fans of suspense! After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. INTRIGUING THINK-PROVOKING INCREDIBLEMIND-BLOWING BEWITCHING.\n",
      "Review 1239: Before viewing this online series, I believed that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon were the finest Indian web series. Voot has selected ASUR, which is the finest Indian online series to date. The film \"The Very Best\" is realistic, brutal, and terrifying. You cannot resign from your respective positions. There are no noteworthy advertisements for Voot Select or this web series. But trust me when I say that it is one of the Jewels, unadulterated Gold, of Indian television and web series culture. I have never rated a film or web series so highly. It is gratifying to observe the improvement of Indian film and television. Our industry has always had exceptional actors, but filmmakers are also putting more emphasis on plot. The quality of our content is also improving. One final word: extraordinary....\n",
      "Review 1240: After observing the performance, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the highest calibre and quality. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal.

I frequently recommend this excellent online series to my peers, and I also enjoy viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 1241: The performance of Asur cannot be summarised in a single phrase. It is easy to communicate profound emotions with a single, straightforward expression. Intelligent forensics expert turned family man, devoted father, and emotionally conflicted spouse. This was a fantastic novel of suspense. The plot holds your interest throughout the duration of the film. I appreciated the excellent work that Bickram Ghosh did with the background music. I experienced shivers during the final scene's BGM. I have just completed watching Asur. It is astounding how gorgeously mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research have been woven into the conception and implementation of this masterpiece; congratulations to the entire team, actors, and staff! I enjoyed each syllable!\n",
      "Review 1242: .As the title of a new #voot series, the term asur, which means \"evil,\" refers to the origin of asur within the human body. The manner in which one priority replaces another. The manner in which your inner fury saves your life. Your viewpoint may be correct for some individuals but not for others. An exceptionally well-written tale of melancholy. Each of the eight episodes completely immerses the audience in the storyline. As with the performances, the conversation with the director is mute. The sum of the team's efforts is astounding. Both must and must not be ignored. Three words: oh my God! What a collection! What a beginning for Vote Select! I've never seen anything like this on Indian television before. The script, direction, and acting are all outstanding. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 1243: Everyone there did their utmost to make it an unforgettable experience. With appreciation to Gaurav Shukla for this amazing literary endeavour. We'd also want to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the crew. I'm interested to see what happens next. The concept is great. It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi in film again after such a long absence. It's a brilliant idea to pit two realms against one terrifying force. I opted to see the film without first seeing the trailer because of the bio. The narrative of forensics specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti as they pursue the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur is more than just a crime thriller. Our ideals, beliefs, and values, as well as our reactions to challenging events, are all being challenged.\n",
      "Review 1244: Before viewing this online series, I believed that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon were the finest Indian web series.

      "Review 1245: Arshad Warsi, you nailed it. It has a brilliant plot and is expertly executed. All of the characters played their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy. Outstanding effort, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! This year, every award will go to Asur. In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end? Clever writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the amount of time taken by creators.\n",
      "Review 1246: The most recent series on #voot is titled \"asur,\" which means \"evil,\" alluding to the fact that this evil originates within each individual. What occurs when one value is substituted for another? The importance of your natural rage to your survival. Your perspective may be accurate, but others may disagree. A very grim story. Each of the eight episodes deepens the story for the viewer. The direction, acting, and writing will astound you. The combined efforts of the team are phenomenal. Must adhere to the regulations. In three simple words: holy crap! Wow, that's a lot of money! Wow, what a beginning for Select voting! I have never before witnessed an Indian performance like this. The writing, direction, and acting are all of the highest calibre. It is a wonderful combination of detective fiction and mythology.\n",
      "Review 1247: Asur's second season is a masterclass in building tension. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti are highlights, but the entire ensemble is superb. The story is exciting and mysterious, keeping you guessing right up to the final page. The show deftly blends scientific fact and myth. The author's utilisation of the Vedas and other ancient books to get insight into the mind of a serial killer is fascinating and unnerving. The bad sides of AI are discussed as well in the show. Both the series' strengths and weaknesses will be discussed here. The strengths of the film include its \"excellent acting\" and the fact that it \"combines folklore with modern technologies.\n",
      "Review 1248: Asur's performance defies succinct description. Surprisingly straightforward is the expression of complex emotions in a simple manner. Intelligent forensics specialist turned family man, now married to a ferocious Asur with whom he has a tumultuous emotional relationship despite their shared intellect. This novel was permeated by incredible tension. The script does an excellent job of maintaining your interest throughout the entirety of the film. I believed that Bickram Ghosh did an excellent job with the soundtrack. The score for the final scene was eerie. I have just finished seeing Asur. This masterwork integrates mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research so brilliantly; congratulations to the entire team, actors, and personnel. Thank you for your feedback!\n",
      "Review 1249: Having personally witnessed the performance, I can affirm that it is of the utmost standard and calibre. It cannot simply be shown to Indians; a global audience is required. The founder and author, Gaurav Shukla, has accomplished a remarkable feat. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal were both involved in its invention. The Series is crammed with tense moments. You spend each passing minute speculating on what will occur next. The optimal method to become conversant with Psycho. I was instantly attracted to this programme upon discovery. This web series is so enthralling due to its plot's originality and intrigue. I enjoy both recommending this web series to my peers and watching it myself.\n",
      "Review 1250: Each episode of Asur 2 is a spectacular mythological story that will hold your attention. This is simply more of the same wicked individual who consistently deceives Dhanjay Rajpoot and his organisation. The author, Arshad Warsi, does an excellent job of depicting the character. The situations of Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are extremely comparable. The narrative of the show is a perfect match for its concept (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and its fusion of legendary mythology. Although the remaining actors performed admirably, the story was drawn out until episode 8 by unnecessary scenes. If the episodes had been more strictly edited, this programme might have lasted six seasons and been a success. A thirty-minute episode of Hacking, in which Anupriya Goneka executes (for amusement) scripts written by programmers for geeks, can be pieced together from multiple Goneka-centric sequences..\n",
      "Review 1251: 99. Asur 2 is a superb mythological story that will have you riveted from the very first episode. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his companions are always plotted against by the same villager. The design of Arshad Warsi is fitting for the character. Knowledge is shared between Varun Arora and Amey Wagh. The idea of the show (AI that anticipates user conduct) and its utilisation of legendary components are a perfect match for one another. The remainder of the performers did a great job, however the tale was dragged out until episode 8 by multiple superfluous sequences. If the episodes had been trimmed down more consistently throughout the season, this programme would have been amazing. In Anupriya Goenka's 30-minute episode of Hacking, she'd run (for fun) computer programmes designed by programmers for computer geeks.\n",
      "Review 1252: Arshad Warsi, you presented an excellent case. The plot is fantastic, and the execution is excellent. Every single one of the actors did an outstanding job. Asur, the Hindi online series with the most emphasis on science and Hinduism, has ended. I'm looking forwards to reading the next chapter. You really outdid yourself, man. Asur will take home the trophy hat trick this year. This online series has the best acting, direction, and story I've ever seen in a web show. I was just talking about... If you wait till all the episodes are out, you can probably guess what they did over the weekend when I was watching it. I am still not back to normal... Just who is Kali, then? How long will this carry on for? A well-written story will leave you wondering what happens next. I can only hope that the wait won't be too long for the authors and publishers.\n",
      "Review 1253: This web series is so well-made that it immediately captivates the audience with its intricate narrative. The series' remarkable narrative aptitude is evidenced by its ability to seamlessly connect episodes and characterise a variety of characters. The series serves as a dismal reminder of the pervasive effects of modern warfare by depicting its devastation. The film industry must produce more web series like this. Please consider my request that production on Season 3 commence as soon as feasible. The magnetic performance of Arshad Warsi as the protagonist lends the show an enigmatic aura, and the writing and acting are of the highest calibre.\n",
      "Review 1254: You have struck the target on the head, Mr. Warsi. The film has an outstanding plot and is deftly directed. Everyone in their respective duties performed exceptionally well. Asur, the greatest Hindi web series to combine a scientific and Hindu worldview, has just concluded. I eagerly anticipate the next chapter. That is an enormous thing, buddy. This year, Asur will dominate the competition. This web series' acting, direction, and plot are all excellent, garnering it a perfect score of 10 from us. What in the world did I do... Since all of the episodes were eventually released over the weekend, I've decided to view it then. I haven't gotten over it yet... Who exactly is Kali, anyway? When will this insanity eventually end? The intelligence of the author will keep you speculating about what will occur next. I can only trust that the time authors and publishers spend on their work is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 1255: The execution should have been sharper and a lot of things could have been changed to make the series an absolute treat. Autopsies, tech, jail and many other scenes are so flawed that you can't stop listing. Extremely careless from the direction. To sum it up, more idiotic things in the final episode make this series look down. Every detail is extremely significant in murder mysteries and you shouldn't go wrong. Hopefully things are better when they come up with the next season. Anyways will wait for proper critics and then will watch the next. It's watchable if you ignore or cannot notice flaws.\n",
      "Review 1256: Just superbly made with intricate details and clear cut tight thriller.Acting by Arshad is awesome. Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, and Anupriya Goenka is very good.One of the Best Thriller Series available.100% must watch.\n",

      "Review 1262: The Character \"ASUR\" is very much Inspired by THE JOKER of Batman Universe, The series is very different than other series, Much Appreciated and Dark Ending worked for me very Well!\n",

      "Review 1266: Those who love crime, mystery based movies/series, it is a gem for those. I'm also a mystery movies lover. What i like about the series is the combination of indian mythology with 21st century's scenario. This makes to believe more in Indian mythology. A new platform for the brilliant but underrated actors where all the actors performed fabulous in the series.\n",

      "Review 1275: First season was good however this one has no plot, no solid story, nothing. The entire 8 episodes could be finished in 2 episodes. It's so lengthy that at some point of time you won't want to know the ending, the story shifts from one place to another without any relation and you will think why that just happened. Even so many casts were not required. In short it was very messy. Watching till very last episode is nothing more than a pain. You will think after so many years they come up with this story line. I would say just see a short video about this season from some youtubers if you want to know, but I would suggest go and watch some different web series. Thanks.\n",

Amazing performance from everyone. This show covers almost all the contemporary issues related to crime minded intelligent man and crime investigation which force you to think and say wow. Best time to spend . Due to this I delayed my work and finished it first. It is an addictive show.\n",
      "Review 1285: Wonderful acting by Arshad, Barun and aditya. Other actors also done their best.\n",
      "Review 1286: Arshad Warsi is simply awesome to watch - a very charming actor who does a lot with very little - the rest of the cast are equally good and it's their relative anonymity that makes their characterisation that much more appealing and believable.\n",

      "Review 1296: My starring may go upward if the cinamatography was improved.Acting done by actors is wonderful.Story binds us till ending.must watch web series.\n",
      "Review 1297: Overall a good web series...keep you engage till 7th episode..Can be predictable..Few observations1. Why this guy Nikhil was gating coordinates.. is not clear2. That guy Asur he himself is learned person, then why he needs Nikhil help in killing the people..3. Arshad Warsi try to look intelligent but looks completely idiot4. CBI have only 1 cyber security guy and that guy looks idiot5. Mythological explanations are good but looks fabricated6. Role of Mukhota is not clear7. Perhaps if Webseries has handed Over case to Crime Petrol team in Episode 7 then results will be well liked and perfect.Baki in lock down time its a long but 1 time watch webseries.\n",
      "Review 1298: ASUR is unimaginably one of the weirdest web series that i have been through a long time.This series will create a huge impact upon the audience as it some where closely allows them to have a look on themselves and understand that whatever is being displayed in the movie is quite comparable and can not be neglected.The plots used in the movie with the amazing cinematography crowns the series with a starmark quotient.A superb portrayal of the evil and the greedy side of every human along with their selfish needs and will is explained thoroughly with great precision.I rate this movie a full 10 as i have totally been amazed with exceptional performance of the actors and the casting of the series.\n",

      "Review 1325: I dont usually watch web series but after watching asur i will surely watch all other series too because asur raised the standard of web series and My favorite web series in indian language is ASUR\n",
      "Review 1326: Everything was good until the last episode when you make a wicked character in the story that everyone hates and there is no positive attitude toward Everyone anticipates his dying or arrest by the police, when after 8 episodes still everything is not solved and the villain is free and good people are killed everything is disappointing and full of despair. It is not good news for viewers. They think they are fooled and waste their time watching this movie, this is why most critics give law ranks.Like a game of thrones, you make a feeling in viewers about the story and at the end, nothing satisfies their feelings you cannot expect good attitudes from this series.\n",
      "Review 1327: A big shout-out to Vishesh Bansal who plays the young Shubh Joshi. The actor is a volcano of talent. Such a complex role and one cannot find a single false note in his performance.\n",
      "Review 1328: Brilliantly crafted with perfect blend of mythology & science Till the justice doesn't favour victims, till the victory is wife of deceit & regret is wife of tears, all stories reflect the suffering of the persecuted\n",

      "Review 1334: All the episodes are highly thrilling and narrated beautifully by the director. The plot is very strong and it's well acted out.\n",
      "Review 1335: I liked the concept, I liked the overall story, acting. Remember one thing this series is about a normal kid when he becomes Asur then he breaks all norms... Okay I am not going to give spoilers. Directors did really well in that part , the balance of mythology and crime he wrote is ultimate.\n",
      "Review 1336: There were several moments in every episode of Asur wherein I found myself clinging on to the sofa, being nervous and waiting in anticipation of the next important turn in the narrative. Tough to remember the last Indian show which did that to me.\n",
      "Review 1337: Well .. plot , background , Indian mythology.. could have been a great mixture but still there are loopholes . overall its good.\n",
      "Review 1338: The way the show ended left me with mixed feelings. But, if there is a second season in the pipeline then, yeah, bring it on I loved the first one and can't wait for 2nd so long\n",
      "Review 1339: When an art outbids its own Inspirations & muses; it's well About time for a well-thought Masterpiece to rise & be created And moulded in the most thorough way Spectacular work by Oni Sen the director, and actors like sharib hashmi Arshad Warsi\n",
      "Review 1340: This is the New Era of the Web Series and Asur is the One of the Finest Web Series of present time. ASUR has started a different kind of the Suspense Thriller typo. Love it.\n",
      "Review 1341: What persuaded me to watch this movie was plot i was very curious to know about how the series .I wasn't prepared for how good it really was\".\"Asur\" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but effective the undertone and the exquisite cinematography.\n",
      "Review 1342: The Story of the Series is fantastic. It has pasted you like a Fevicol to your seat. The Best suspense is that in which every Minute one question has raised What happened next. ASUR gives the Same.\n",
      "Review 1343: This programme is unlike any other since it has no foul language and focuses completely on the plot. Your friends and family may enjoy themselves. The seven or eight hours you devote to watching this series will be well spent. In conclusion, the performances and camerawork are both quite good. There is not a single typo in any of the episodes. The quality of Asur has made it a fan favourite. While nursing my Asur hangover, I still couldn't find a single flaw in this. The soundtracks begin and end with foreboding music. It has been ingrained in me. I can state without hesitation that this concert is among the very finest I've ever seen. I have nothing but praise for the writing, directing, and performances. I was able to finish Asur in one sitting. It'sa first for me to watch two Web shows in a single day. Finally, a show that can hold its own intellectually against western media. I admire the professionalism with which you've organised this series.\n",
      "Review 1344: Asur is the best crime thriller which is very interesting.I enjoyed a lot by watching this series. Thriller story lovers will definitely love it. It is based on ancient mythology.I suggest everyone to watch this series for sure. Encouraging such kind of stories is good because everyone can learn how to act in a particular situation.\n",

      "Review 1362: In my view, one of the best Bollywood films ever created. Dr. Barun Sobti in particular stands out for his outstanding performance. This is the finest online series I've watched in a long time, and it has piqued my interest in Bollywood entertainment. I hope the second season matches up to the first, and I appreciate the cast and crew's efforts. Please watch it because it is a masterpiece; there are no spoilers in this post, but I am tempted to give you one. This novel surpasses the thriller genre. It tricks your mind. The plot grows brilliantly around the midway of the series and leaves you wanting more. This programme is a \"psychological thriller\" in the fullest sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 1363: I can blindly say this is the best ever made thriller of indian industry. You well never regret after watching, I signed up to imdb just to review this series.Must watch!\n",

      "Review 1370: I'm very happy to watch this webseries on a single run and eagerly waiting for the second season. The plot creation is upto mark and suspension is at every moment. The awesome part is everyone has dark side always and in this they explained clearly. In this webseries mysterious myths are covered and one important thing is no one is born as asur or sur the situation and surrounding makes them what they want.\n",

      "Review 1379: Last week I watched Asur On Voot what a fabulous acting Arshad Warsi sir.\n",
      "Review 1380: A brilliantly scripted series where it makes you fall in love with each and every positive character and makes you hate the gut of every negative ones. I guess that makes it a piece of its own.\n",
      "Review 1381: The climax is unpredictable and heart-breaking and i was left anxious for hours later. But that's what a good series does right? You get to watch the entire set of episodes on the edge not knowing whats going to happen next.\n",
      "Review 1382: Asur is one of the best series to come out of India. Not only does it have some fine acting by every actor, but it also has good story to keep you hooked. It is crisp and to the point\n",
      "Review 1383: This series is the best among all and i'm eagerly waiting for season 2. If you hadn't watched this yet then what are you waiting for?

      "Review 1389: Asur is a #MustWatch web series Thanks me later ..\n",
      "Review 1390: Quarntine can't be better than this Asur On Voot what an outstanding web series\n",
      "Review 1391: Yes, you're totally right, Arshad Warsi. The premise is great, and it is handled quite well. The entire group did a fantastic job embodying their characters. The best Hindi web series, Asur, brilliantly marries Hindu spiritual ideas with scientific ones. I was completely engrossed and now I can't wait for the next chapter. Every award that may be given out this year will go to Asur. A web series with the greatest acting, director, and storyline gets a perfect score of 10/10. What I just did is beyond my comprehension. On the weekend, when all the episodes are released (conveniently, they filmed on the weekend), I'll give it a go. Still reeling from the unexpectedness... Break down Kali's identity for me. To what extent does this go on? The best literature leaves its readers wondering right up until the final page. Let's cross our fingers that the production and publishing stages don't take too long.\n",
      "Review 1392: Outstanding concept, I would like to say it's the concept that today's generation need unlike just action & romantic movies. Great effort and ofcourse Arshad Warsi - The fabulous actor. Just loved it. Now eagerly waiting for S02.\n",
      "Review 1393: This story tells you that there is no one who is completely good person there is a dark side always stays in a corner inside.\n",
      "Review 1394: This programme is unique in that it avoids vulgarity and swearing while concentrating completely on the plot. You and your family could have a nice time. It is not a waste of time to set aside seven to eight hours to watch this series. Finally, the performances and camerawork are both excellent. There isn't a single error in the entire series. Because it is outstanding, Asur is a popular show. I have an Asur hangover, but I can't think of anything wrong with this. Both the opening and ending soundtracks contain foreboding music. It's been instilled in me. This concert is without a doubt one of the greatest I've ever seen. I can't speak highly enough of the story, directing, and performances. I watched the entire series Asur in a single day. It's a first for me to watch two Web shows in one day. Finally, a programme capable of competing intellectually with western entertainment. I appreciate you putting on such an excellent series.\n",
      "Review 1395: As each episode of Asur 2 exposes new secrets, the series is the ideal mythological suspense. The same group of crooks always manages to con Dhanjay Rajpoot and his group. Arshad Warsi portrayed the well-written role brilliantly. Varun Arora and Amey wagh share the same predicament. The foundation of the programme (using AI to predict and analyse user activity) and the incorporation of a legendary theme are a perfect match for the narrative of the show. Other Starcast members have also performed admirably, but the story meanders on until episode 8 due to superfluous, lengthy passages. If the episodes had been edited more precisely, the programme might have ended after six seasons. Fun aside, the programme will be approximately thirty minutes long and will comprise of her executing algorithms designed by geeks for nerds.\n",
      "Review 1396: Asur's effectiveness is difficult to sum up in a few words. The depth of feeling communicated by even a single glance is astonishing. During the day, he's a brilliant forensics specialist, and at night, he's a loving husband and father to his Scary Asur wife, with whom he has difficulty finding common ground. This was indeed a spectacular show. The script keeps the audience interested all the way through. One of my favourite parts of the picture was the music, which was written by Bickram Ghosh. The music at the end of the movie was eerie. Asur is the latest movie I've watched. Incredible effort went into incorporating mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterwork by the team, performers, and crew. I enjoyed it a lot.\n",
      "Review 1397: This programme marks out for its absence of offensive language and sexual content. It's perfect for a family night in. The 7-8 hours you devote to this programme will be well spent. In summation, both the performances and cinematography are of the highest quality. The entire series is flawless in every respect. Not only is Asur a popular programme, but it also deserves its high ratings. I have a severe case of Asur hangover, and I cannot identify a single flaw in this. Both the opening and closing tracks are eerie. I cannot stop thinking about it. It truly ranks among the greatest performances I've ever witnessed. The writing, direction, and acting are all extremely impressive. Asur was viewed in a single session. I've never completed a Web series in a single sitting. Finally, a programme that can intellectually contend with the West. I appreciate you making available this excellent series.\n",
      "Review 1398: It's possible to misunderstand the asur's nasty connotation. New material for #voot. The asur in the human body is alluded to by the series' title. Priorities shift with the tide. Your inner asur will step in to save the day in this situation. It's possible that someone will agree with you while someone other will strongly disagree. What a beautifully written tragic story. There are a total of eight episodes, and the intensity of the plot increases with each one. The show and the talk both leave you speechless. The group's dedication is quite impressive. Not to be missed. How can you say that in only three words? What a fantastic performance! Wow, Voot select has gotten off to a roaring start! There is nothing on Indian television like this. The storyline, the directing, and the performances were all superb. It's effective in blending crime with mythology.\n",
      "Review 1399: To start with: Biggest fan of Arshad Warsi. This couldn't get any better. Thriller story and Arshad Warsi is the best combination ever. Considering this is his first web series, he has not let us down.The plot and story is excellent and can be regarded as on of the best Hindi Series till date. The tagline is perfect and you have got to see the series to understand about it.Acting wise, yes I feel there can be improvement but as a unit everyone compliments each other very well.\n",
      "Review 1400: Excellent plot, acting. Webseries like asur are proving that indians can make excellent content with finesse.\n",
      "Review 1401: In the scene in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a victim, there is an editing error. Asur is flawless in every aspect, but its writing in particular keptme speculating until the very end. I am completely caught up on Asur and have watched every episode. The fragrance is extraterrestrial. Slow at times, but worthwhile for the deeper dive into Indian mythology and story it provides. Therefore, I did not find it irritating. After a prolonged absence, I eventually saw an urdu thriller, and it was well worth the wait. This time, Arshad Warsi joins Asur before the cameras and his digital screen audience. The screenplay and direction are superbly realised. The actors are in flawless harmony with one another. Everyone there gave their all to make it a memorable evening. The author, Gaurav Shukla, has done an excellent work with this. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the personnel should also be commended for their endeavours. The next task is pending completion.\n",
      "Review 1402: This series is definitely a number one in Indian tv series. Based on scientific, murder, mythology well blended and the dark theme of the series is a must watch. Its available on local languages. Do watch it.\n",
      "Review 1403: Very bad writing. Not worth the hype. The story fizzles out after a couple of episodes. Very disappointing.\n",
      "Review 1404: The overall suspense was great. The background score was good. However, the plot has many holes and it has some absurd scenes. The ending was very confusing.\n",
      "Review 1405: In the past, I had considered Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon to be the two finest Indian web series available at the time. Watching ASUR has convinced me that it is the finest Indian web series ever produced. This is terrifying because it is based in reality and savagery; it deserves the title \"The Best.\" Your attention will be held. Neither this web series nor Vootselect have been marketed heavily. Take my word for it though; that's a perfect example of Indian online content. Never before have I praised a film or web series so enthusiastically. Seeing Bollywood and Indian television evolve positively is a heartening trend. Talented actors and actresses have long worked in our profession, but in recent years, filmmakers have begun to place greater importance on plot. The quality of our writing has also improved. Finally, a no-nonsense comparison....\n",
      "Review 1406: Arshad Warsi, you nailed it. It has a brilliant plot and is expertly executed. All of the characters played their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy. Outstanding effort, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! This year, every award will go to Asur. In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end? Clever writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the amount of time taken by creators and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 1407: If you loved the Anime Death Note then this is definitely a worth watch for you. Almost 3 Years of long wait finally ends with season 2. Super tight screenplay and top notch performances of all the casts make you to binge watch. Story is basically a person wants to control or create the whole world that we we have seen in death note. The only drawback i found is that CBI and Government always fails because SHUBH knows what is going to happen next hence we can't digest it easily otherwise all the things were good including BGM, Production value , Story, Locations etc.Go for it , it definitely worth your time.\n",
      "Review 1408: There is a mistake in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a character. The writing in Asur is excellent, and it had me wondering and interested right up until the very end. I'm caught up on the entire run of Asur. It has an incredible flavour. Despite the slow spots, this is a great way to learn about the narrative and Indian mythology. I didn't hate it, after all. After a long time away, I finally got around to seeing an Urdu thriller film that had my attention right up to the conclusion. This time, Arshad Warsi joins Asur on the big screen in front of the crowd and his followers. Fantastically written and expertly carried out flick. The actors' timing and cooperation in each scene is spot on. Everyone who was a part of it worked hard to make it special. Gaurav Shukla deserves special recognition for the excellent work he has done in writing. In addition to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team's fantastic work. Currently awaiting my next task.\n",
      "Review 1409: The lack of explicit sexual content and language is a hallmark of this series. The whole family can enjoy it. If you can spare seven to eight hours, you should watch this series. In addition, both the acting and the camerawork are top-notch. The entire series is flawless and without flaw. The high ratings for Asur are fully earned, and the show is excellent. There is not a single error in this. A severe Asur hangover has set in. The music at the beginning and the end is disturbing. It has permanently imprinted itself on my mind. Actually, it's up there with the finest performances I've ever seen. I really can't stop praising the storyline, the directing, and the acting. A single day was all it took to see Asur. Before today, I had never seen a full Web series in one sitting. At last, an intelligence programme on par with the West. I appreciate you making such a great show.\n",
      "Review 1410: Each episode of Asur 2 is packed with suspense and mythical intrigue. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his colleagues are repeatedly fooled by the same cabal. To the character's credit, Arshad Warsi did the writing justice. This applies just as well to Amey wagh as it does to Varun Arora. The show's premise (using AI to anticipate and analyse user activity) and the legendary story it tells are a great match. Other Starcast members have also done a great job, although the tale drags on for too long due to certain unneeded extended passages. If the editing had been tight, this show may have run for six episodes. Hacking sequences with Anupriya Gokhale will be a short episode (about 30 minutes) in which she uses algorithms designed by computer scientists for nerds.\n",
      "Review 1411: The lack of profanity and the intense concentration on the tale make this performance stand out from the crowd. You and your loved ones could enjoy themselves. You won't squander seven or eight hours viewing this series. Finally, both the director and the cinematography are top-notch. Every episode is spot-on and accurate. Asur's popularity stems from the high quality of the show. Even with the Asur hangover, I don't see any issues with this. The opening and closing titles both feature dark, ominous soundtracks. It's integrated into who I am now. This concert was, without a doubt, one of the finest of my life. Excellent writing, direction, and acting. Asur was seen from beginning to end in a single sitting. I seldom watch more than one Web series in a day. Finally, a show that can compete with the western media on an intellectual level. Your podcast is fantastic, and I applaud your efforts.\n",
      "Review 1412: Asur all chacters are goodAnd acting of all actors are to much imperisingIn this science n mythology both are shown in best wayDark n evil side of every people are shown in this it very good seriesMust watch this.\n",
      "Review 1413: This is the best Hindi web series till date. Just like the concept and balance of good,bad,evil,angel. IT is perfect and Subh dialogue give me goosebumps. Eagerly waiting for season 2.\n",
      "Review 1414: The second season of Asur is a well-crafted and intriguing drama. The performances are exceptional, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti particularly standing out. The narrative moves quickly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series does an excellent job of incorporating mythology and technology. The use of the Vedas and other ancient religions to explain the killer's motives is both fascinating and ominous. The series also examines the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it can be used for evil...Here are some of the series' advantages and disadvantages: Pros: *Excellent acting *Well-paced story *Thrilling suspense *Thought-provoking It combines mythology and technology. Some of the visual effects are inferior. -Several plotgaps exist.\n",
      "Review 1415: It is a mind-blowing series due to theacting, planning, aesthetics, music, and, of course, the story. All of the actors, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riyadh Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will undoubtedly win the award. It is the type of series that prompts viewers to question whether or not what they believe to be proper is in fact correct. This series does a fantastic job of combining technology and folklore. I highly recommend it, and sure, I am looking foreword to the third season. This is an outstanding suspense novel that will keep you wondering throughout. The trailer does not do credit to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensics, gorgeous background music, and an excellent screenplay/story. Avoid missing out.\n",
      "Review 1416: Before seeing this online series, I felt the best Indian web series were Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon. But that has all changed now that Voot has named ASUR the best web serial produced in India to date. This is \"The Very Best,\" and it is realistic, nefarious, and horrifying. You'll be glued to your seats. There are no significant Voot select or Web series promotions. But believe me when I tell it is a gem, pure gold, in Indian television and web series culture. I've never written such a favourable review for a film or web series before. It is heartening to see that the standard of Indian movies and television is rising. Our profession has always had wonderful actors, but filmmakers are now focused on story as well. Our stories' quality is also increasing. Finally, there is one word that springs to mind: brilliant.....\n",
      "Review 1417: One of the best I've ever seen in BollywoodActing skills just awesomeMy personal favourite BARUN SOBTIIt is the best I have seen of Arshad Warsi waiting for season 2 eagerly this has been the best web series I have watched in a while I am and Hollywood web series lover but this made me eager for Bollywood content also hope the next season must come up with the same perfection and excellence this must get a lot of awards thanks to all the team for this and once again waiting for the season 2 this do not contains any spoiler but I am eager to tell you one but I am controlling myself so please watch it it is masterpiece.\n",
      "Review 1418: Asur Season 2 is a well-crafted and interesting drama. The performances are outstanding, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti standing out. The narrative goes rapidly and leaves you in suspense until the very end. The series does a fantastic job of blending mythology with technology. The use of the Vedas and other ancient religions to explain the killer's intentions is both interesting and frightening. The series also explores the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it may be used for evil...Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: Pros: *Excellent acting *Well-paced story *Thrilling suspense *Thought-provokingIt blends mythology with technology. Cons: -Some of the visual effects are subpar. -There are a few plot holes.\n",
      "Review 1419: The absence of explicit sexual content and language distinguishes this series from others. If desired, include everyone in the household. Seven or eight hours is suggested for viewing the entire series. Moreover, the cinematography and performances are excellent. The entire series is outstanding from start to finish. Asur's high favorability ratings are merited. There is no singular vulnerable point. My Asur hangover has reached its peak. The opening and concluding music are extremely ominous. My thoughts continually return to that instant. Without exaggeration, one of the loveliest concerts I've ever attended. From the script to the direction to the acting, I adored every aspect of this film. I completed Asur in a single session. Never before have I watched an entire Web series in one session. Finally, a sophisticated programme capable of competing with the developed world. Please accept my sincere appreciation for putting on such an outstanding performance.\n",
      "Review 1420: You have made a very valid point, Arshad Warsi. The narrative is fantastic, and the film is well directed. Each and every one of the actors gave outstanding performances. Completed Asur, the top scientifically and Hindu-friendly Hindi online serial. I'm looking forwards to the next installment in the series. Fantastic work, man. This year, Asur will sweep the honours. I have never seen a web series with better acting, directing, or a more compelling tale than this one. Sorry, I lost my train of thought there. You can probably guess what they did over the weekend, and I plan to watch it as soon as all the episodes are available. I still can't believe that happened to me... Who is this mysterious Kali? When will this madness finally stop? You should always be left wondering what happens next in a well-written work. I can only hope that the length of time it takes authors and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 1421: This masterfully constructed web series effortlessly captivates its audience, drawing them into the story's intricate complexities. The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is demonstrated by the exceptional characterisation of multiple characters and the continuity between episodes. By exposing the destructive effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry must produce more web series with such high-quality screenplays. Therefore, I advise the creators to begin Season 3 production as soon as possible. The intriguing portrayal of the main character by Arshad Warsi adds to the series' perplexing nature, and the writing is excellent.\n",
      "Review 1422: Asur 2 is an episode-by-episode mythological thriller with incredible developments. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team are routinely duped by a recurring gang of swindle artists. Arshad Warsi has done the character justice, who is so ingeniously crafted. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh share a similar situation. The premise of the show is perfectly adapted to the underlying principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the combination of legendary tales. Other members of the Starcast have also performed admirably, but certain passages are so lengthy as to be superfluous and extend the narrative until episode eight. If the editing had been precise, six episodes would have been sufficient for this programme. Hacking Sequences is a 30-minute brief episode in which Anupriya Gokhale implements algorithms created by nerds for geeks.\n",
      "Review 1423: It is a mind-blowing series because ofthe acting, plot, aesthetics, music, and, most importantly, the story. All of the actors, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will certainly receive the honour. It's the type of series that makes you question what is right and whether what we believe to be right is actually accurate. The creators of this series exerted substantial effort to combine technology and myth. Highly recommended...watch it, and certainly, you should look forwards to the third season. This is a mind-boggling suspense novel that will provoke thought. The trailer does not do justice to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensics, excellent background music, and an outstanding screenplay/plot. This should not be ignored.\n",
      "Review 1424: The performance of Asur cannot be summarised in a single phrase. It is easy to communicate profound emotions with a single, straightforward expression. Intelligent forensics expert turned family man, devoted father, and emotionally conflicted spouse. This was a fantastic novel of suspense. The plot holds your interest throughout the duration of the film. I appreciated the excellent work that Bickram Ghosh did with the background music. I experienced shivers during the final scene's BGM. I have just completed watching Asur. It is astounding how gorgeously mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research have been woven into the conception and implementation of this masterpiece; congratulations to the entire team, actors,\n",
      "Review 1425: A new series on #voot features the word #asur, which means \"evil.\" As a designation for a series, it refers to the origin of asur within the human body. How one priority replaces another. How your inner anger rises to save your life. Your opinion may be correct for some but incorrect for others. A very well-written sombre narrative. Each of the eight episodes draws the viewer deeply into the story. The dialogue to the direction is speechless, as is the acting. The team's collective effort is astounding. Must and must observe. Just three words, holy crap! What a collection! What a beginning for Vote select! I've never seen such Indian tv series yet. The script, direction, and acting are all outstanding. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 1426: Due to the numerous plot developments in each episode, Asur 2 is an excellent mythological thriller that will keep you captivated until the very end. It is simply a continuation of the vile individual who consistently deceives Dhanjay Rajpoot and his group. The character has been effectively portrayed by Arshad Warsi, and the script is superb. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are in identical circumstances. The premise of the show (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the incorporation of legendary mythology complement the plot flawlessly. Other cast members also performed admirably, but.\n",
      "Review 1427: Or the actors, actresses, and directors. Certainly merits a look. Season 2 piques my interest. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe this programme in a few words. INTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING SPELLBOUNDING After viewing the programme, I can confidently assert that it is of the highest calibre and world-class. It must be shown to audiences worldwide, not just in India. His team of writers, led by Gaurav Shukla, did an outstanding job. Thanks to Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt, Oni Sen's direction is outstanding. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib.\n",

      "Review 1429: One of the most excellent Bollywood flicks I've ever watched. My personal favourite is BARUN SOBTI. It is the finest I've seen of Arshad Warsi, and I'm looking forwards to the second season. This is the finest online series I've watched in quite some time. I enjoy Hollywood web series, but this has piqued my interest in Bollywood stuff. I'm hoping the second season lives up to the first. There are no spoilers in this article, but I am tempted to divulge one. However, I shall not do so because the film is a work of art. This is more than just a thriller series. It stimulates your mind. The narrative progresses effectively, and the series concludes with you wanting more! This show is a \"psychological thriller\" in the best meaning of the phrase.\n",
      "Review 1430: This series is distinguished by its lack of obscenity and foul language in preference of authentic substance. You may have a pleasant time with your family. If you devote seven to eight hours to this series, you will not be disappointed. Lastly, the performances and photography are both excellent. The entire series is flawless; not a single flaw exists. Asur is not only a popular programme, but it also merits its popularity. There are no flaws; everything is perfect. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. The beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It is ingrained in me. Honestly, this is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot get enough of the story, direction, and acting in this film. I completed watching Asur in one day. It is the first time I have ever viewed two Web programmes on the same day. Finally, a show with as much intelligence as western programmes. Thank you for creating such an excellent.\n",
      "Review 1431: After observing the performance, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the highest calibre and quality. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. Suspense prevails throughout the series. You agonise about the future every minute and second. Excellent summary of the Psycho character. I was instantly drawn to this series upon my initial exposure to it. It's truly mind-boggling, and the story's premise is both intriguing and perplexing, which adds to the web series' intrigue. I frequently recommend this excellent online series to my peers, and I also enjoy viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 1432: This series stands out for its absence of vulgarity and harsh language in favour of real content. You could have a good time with your family. You will not be disappointed if you dedicate seven to eight hours to this series. Finally, the acting and photography are both great. There isn't a single fault in the entire series. Asur is not just a popular programme, but it also deserves to be popular. Everything is flawless; there are no defects. I'm suffering from an Asur hangover. The background music at the start and conclusion is unsettling. It's instilled in me. To be honest, this is one of the best concerts I've ever seen. I can't get enough of this film's plot, directing, and performances. I finished watching Asur in a single day. It's the first time I've ever seen two Web shows on the same day. Finally, a show with the same level of sophistication as western programming. Thank you for generating such a wonderful series.\n",

Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra all delivered outstanding performances. The honour will surely go to this series. It's the kind of series that leaves you with a lot of doubts about what is right and whether what we think is right is actually correct. The creators of this series have gone to considerable pains to blend technology with legend. Highly recommended...watch it, and yes, you should be excited for season three.

      "Review 1436: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything in Asur is excellent, but the writing kept me puzzled and captivated until the very end. I have watched each episode of Asur. It is very impressive. It occasionally proceeds slowly, but this helps the reader comprehend the plot and Indian mythology. So I had no objections. After a lengthy absence, I watched an Urdu suspense that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears alongside Asur on a digital projection for the audience and his followers. The script and execution of this film are outstanding. Each performer has flawless action synchronisation. Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment.\n",

      "Review 1440: The absence of explicit language and profane material is one of the defining characteristics of the series. Time spent with family and friends can be rewarding. This series will require at least seven to eight hours of your time. Last but not least, the acting and camerawork are both excellent. There is not a solitary issue with the series as a whole. Not only is Asur a popular programme, but it also deserves its high ratings. I have an Asur hangover, but I was unable to identify a single flaw in this. Both the opening and closing tracks are menacing. It is now entrenched in my memory. I can honestly state that this concert is among the best I've ever witnessed. I simply must commend the script, direction, and performances. Recently, I spent an entire day viewing the entirety of Asur. I have never viewed two Web series in a single day. Finally, a programme that can intellectually compete with westerners. I appreciate the high quality of this series.\n",
      "Review 1441: One of the most stupid series. After watching asur first season I, did not have any courage to watch asur seasons2 . Just unnecessarily created hype. Similar story line, and most episodes are dragging and end is ridiculous. Complete series is without any logic. Not sure why so much hate is shown toward brahmins in this series. Just to malign image of hindu, Brahmins and religious scripture. All tales and examples given from religious scripture were without any logic or proper research. Almost wasted time to watch 8 episodes. However acting was good from most of the characters in the series, but it is a complete waste of time..\n",
      "Review 1442: Arshad Warsi, you made an outstanding point. It has a compelling narrative and is deftly directed. All of the actors deserve praise for their outstanding performances. Completed Asur, the finest Hindu-centric and scientifically oriented Hindi web series. I eagerly anticipate the upcoming sequel. Wow, excellent work, man. This year, Asur will receive every award. I've never seen a web series with better acting, direction, and plot than this one. What was I just discussing... When all the episodes are released, I'll watch it, and you can probably guess what they did over the weekend. I haven't gotten over it yet... Who exactly is Kali, anyway? When will this be over? A well-written piece will leave the reader anticipating what will occur next. I can only trust that the time required by authors and publishers is not excessive.\n",
      "Review 1443: Asur 2 is a magnificent mythological drama with surprising plot twists in each episode that will keep you glued to the screen until the very end. It is always the same villager who plots against Dhanjay Rajpoot and his crew. The character is created ingeniously, and Arshad Warsi deserves credit for that. The experience is shared by Varun Arora and Amey Wagh. The show's premise (AI for anticipating user behaviour) and use of mythological elements complement each other splendidly. The remaining actors also did an excellent job, but the story was drawn out until episode 8 by superfluous sequences. If the episodes had been more precisely edited, the entire season of this show would have been excellent. The totality of Anupriya Goenka'sHacking would fit into a 30-minute episode, and she would be seen executing geek-created codes (as a form of entertainment) for other nerds.\n",

      "Review 1445: One of the best Bollywood movies ever made, in my view. I've been hoping for a web series like SOBTI BARUN, and it hasn't disappointed me. Season one had a spectacular performance by one of my all-time favourite actors, Arshad Warsi; I can't wait for what season two has in store. Now I can't wait to check out some more Bollywood flicks. The movie aroused my interest in Bollywood, and while I usually watch American TV, I feel forced to suggest it to you because of its aesthetic quality, so I won't spoil anything. The story itself is amazing, but that's not all it is. As a means of mental exercise, this is superb. At about the halfway point, the show starts to really get going in terms of the story it's telling. If you want to see a good example of a psychological thriller, go no further than this show..\"\n",
      "Review 1446: Instead, the performers, directors, and musicians are credited. It is certainly worth observing. I cannot wait for the second season to begin. After watching the entire season of this programme, I have some thoughts to share. I can affirm categorically that the programme is of the highest calibre and standard; it is riveting, thought-provoking, astounding, mind-boggling, and hypnotic. It must be disseminated internationally, not just in India. His authors, which included Gaurav Shukla, produced excellent work. Both Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen perform admirably as captains. All of the actors, including Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra and Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh, perform admirably. Seeing the performance in person will leave a lasting impression. I cannot wait for the second season to begin.\n",
      "Review 1447: When you consider the acting, narrative, aesthetics, music, and story of the series, you'll agree that it's excellent. All of the actors, from Arshad Warsi to Barun Sobti to Anupriya Goenka to Abhishek Chauhan to Riddhi Dogra to Meiyang Chang to Amey Wagh to Pawan Chopra, did an outstanding job. Without a doubt, this series is deserving of the award. It's the type of programme that stays with you and makes you question whether the values we hold dear are the correct ones. This programme has gone above and beyond to incorporate elements of science fiction and fantasy. I exhort you to watch it and can state unequivocally that I eagerly anticipate the third season. This mind-bending suspense novel will keep you pondering long after you've completed reading it. The trailer does not do justice to the film. A script that encompasses everything from mythology to forensic psychology to score-worthy score music. Do not pass up this opportunity.\n",
      "Review 1448: The scene in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting another character contains an editing error. Asur is flawless in every respect, but I had no notion what was going on while reading it. I am current on the entirety of Asur. It is notably distinctive. Indian mythology is well worth the effort, despite the fact that it can be tedious at times. Therefore, it did not bother me in the least. After a lengthy delay, I was eventually able to witness an engrossing Hindi drama. Arshad Warsi, who has previously portrayed Asur, is recast for the benefit of his admirers. This film's screenplay and production are excellent. Each and every performer's action synchronisation is faultless. Everyone there did their best to ensure it was a memorable experience. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent literary work. We would also like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I am excited to see what transpires next.\n",
      "Review 1449: You see shows like Mirzapur and Sacred Games that thrive on crime drama with Indian flavours and some abuses.But this show is certainly a different treat for Indian spectators.A series that thrives on suspense/thriller genre with an ever gripping and super engrossing plot.The way they have combined investigation and Indian Mythology is superb.Arshad Warsi ascends out of his slumber and the man has killed it. As natural as it gets,Incredible performance.Barun Sobti can't be compared with the likes of Warsi in this show, but somehow he adapts to his character with a subtleness.Anupriya Goenka ,Riddhi Dogra and the supporting cast do the needful .The best part about Asur is the way it unfolds and grips you and how it pertains to the title.Binge watching stuff.\n",
      "Review 1450: This series stands out for its absence of immorality and filthy language. It is suitable for family enjoyment. You will not be disappointed if you devote 7-8 hours to this course. Last but not least, the acting and cinematography are also outstanding. There isn't one fault in the entire series. Asur is not just a popular series, but it also deserves to be such. This has no drawbacks; everything is perfect. I'm suffering from an Asur hangover. The background music at the beginning and end is unsettling. It has been embedded in my thoughts. It is, without a doubt, one of the best concerts I have ever seen. I can't stop complimenting the screenplay, directing, and performances. I only watched Asur in one day. This is the first time I've ever finished a Web series in a single day. Finally, a software with Western-level intellect. Thank you for putting up such an excellent series.\n",
      "Review 1451: I would consider this one of the best Bollywood films I've ever seen. Excellent performance by everyone, but particularly by DR. BARUN SOBTI (my favourite). This has piqued my interest in Indian films and television, despite the fact that I appreciate viewing American web series. I anticipate the upcoming season with the same level of anticipation. This article contains no spoilers, but I feel obligated to mention one, so please check out this masterpiece regardless. This reading material is more than just suspenseful. It is an intellectual deception. At the halfway point, the plot has advanced beautifully, and you're left desiring more. This show's description as a \"psychological thriller\" is an understatement.\n",
      "Review 1452: I ended up binge watching it in one day. It's that good. Background score is amazing. Acting is believable. Script is the hero. However the ending could have been better. It reminded me of The dark knight somehow.Anyways it was a fine attempt by the director and the team. Kudos for giving us our very own psycho killer drama. Can't wait for next season.\n",
      "Review 1453: They could have made the ending like \"Dark Knight\"1 star deducted for the same.\n",
      "Review 1454: You know what makes a crime thriller boring? When the criminal is using logic but the investigators work on intuition. In this series, many parts are done right, but whenever the lead investigator used intuition, I lost interest.The antagonist is sketched nicely- you get to know what he is like he is. His story and how it knits the plot is the part I like the most. The rest of the characters are done good but not something that you might not have seen before.I am surprised (read shocked) by the rave reviews that this series has received. I feel it is now part of the marketing budget of the OTT platforms. It is getting closer to a time when I will stop factoring IMDB reviews seriously!\n",
      "Review 1455: Good but not even nearly as good as season 1 of sacred games. Everything about this is just okay. Background score is excellent though. Cinematography is good too. But the problem is screenplay. Lot more should have been done to show the background of all important characters. That would have made some characters likeable or relatable. Most episodes don't have any peak exciting moment. It's just forgettable.However, must say that all actors did great acting and that kinda saved the show.\n",
      "Review 1456: Same person doing smarest work and unlogical work...Neither a drama nor a scientific movie..It is Daram and science khichdi...\n",
      "Review 1457: Asur 2 is a fantastic mythological thriller with twists and turns that reveal themselves in each episode. It's a reoccurring bunch of crooks that con Dhanjay Rajpoot and his squad. Arshad Warsi has done credit to the character, which is so brilliantly crafted. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are in the same boat. The show's premise is perfectly suited to the principle on which it is based (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the combination of legendary stories. Other members of the Starcast have also played wonderfully, however certain passages are so long that they are unnecessary and stretch the story until episode 8. This show would have been perfect for six episodes if the editing had been precise. If you're putting together Anupriya Gokhale's Hacking Sequences, it'll be a 30-minute short episode in which she implements algorithms designed by geeks for geeks.\n",
      "Review 1458: Very amazing movie. Superb cast. Just loved it so much. I can watch it again and again. Such a lovely movie. One of the best i have watched. Amazing plot with such amazing scenes and visuals. I really loved the actors. Its worth the time such a great movie.\n",
      "Review 1459: The concept of asur is good. I also liked the music composition. The Indian mythical flavours are attractive. (Initally reminded of tumbaad) l.There are loopholes. Here there are misses which make u feel pitty. If you like the concept and not any other sereis in list can watch this.\n",
      "Review 1460: Must watch...... üíØ% recommended. It's a masterpiece.\n",
      "Review 1461: Alternatively, the performers, director, and music. Definitely worth viewing. Season two is eagerly anticipated. After watching the full season, I'd want to summarise the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBINDING INTRIGUING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can state with some certainty that the performance is of the greatest level and grade. It must be shown to audiences all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, the inventor and author, has done an outstanding job. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal's work was effectively monitored by Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, BarunSobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh. The concert will leave an indelible mark on your mind. I'm looking forwards to the second season.\n",
      "Review 1462: US/ Spanish series have finally have a strong contender in this genre. absolute classss.\n",
      "Review 1463: Asur 2 is a fantastic mythological thriller that will keep you engaged till the end thanks to the twists and turns that appear in each episode. It is merely a continuation of the villen who always dupes DhanjayRajpoot and his gang. Arshad Warsi has done the character well, and the script is fantastic. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are both in the same situation. The premise of the show (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the fusion of fabled mythology perfectly complement the narrative. Other cast members fared well as well, however some of the passages were unnecessary and extended the story till episode 8. If the editing had been finer, this show would have been fantastic for six episodes. If you put AnupriyaGoenka's Hacking scenes together, you'll have a 30-minute episode in which she executes codes developed by geeks for geeks (for fun).\n",
      "Review 1464: Yep it has some issue but you can't denay the brilliance of this....ignore the bad reviews those are the guys who watched a lot of english drama......just give it a try\n",
      "Review 1465: It's tough to convey Asur's effectiveness in a few words. It only took one look, yet the amount of emotion it conveyed was astonishing. By day, he is a forensic specialist, and by night, he is a loving husband and father to his Scary Asur wife. What a fantastic page-turner! The narrative keeps things entertaining throughout. The soundtrack, which was composed by Bickram Ghosh and was outstanding, was one of my favourite aspects of the film. I got chills from the music in the end credits. I recently completed watching Asur. It's incredible how the authors, directors, actors, and technicians all collaborated to incorporate so many various disciplines of study into the creation of this masterpiece. It was a lot of fun for me.\n",
      "Review 1466: It is just feboulus. THE BEST THRILLER I HAVE SEEN EVER\n",
      "Review 1467: Don't be misled by the title; \"asur\" means \"evil\" in Arabic, and the title of the series relates to the psychological underpinnings of evil. Priorities shift with the passage of time. How far your inner asur will go to protect you. Your point of view may be correct for you but incorrect for others. A scary and brilliantly produced narrative. There are eight episodes in total, and the suspense builds gradually. The entire production, from the writing to the performers, blew me away. The group effort is remarkable. This is not to be missed. Oh my goodness!! Is sufficient in and of itself. Isn't it quite a series of events? This is an excellent first step for Voot to take. This is the first time an Indian television show has shown in the United States. Everything about it was fantastic, from the screenplay to the direction to the acting. It's the ideal blend of mystery and mystique.\n",
      "Review 1468: This is indeed a best triller and great series to watch worth of you time and great work by Arshad Warsi , love this for sure surely this is best to watch\n",
      "Review 1469: I loved the series, it's one of the most entertaining web series made in India.\n",
      "Review 1470: Excellent performances by Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti. Arshad warsi deserves good roles like dj rajput. Barun sobti has excelled as nikhil nair. And barun plz don't go in hibernation. We luv to watch u. Keep doing such great work. All supporting cast has also done commendable job. Kudos to director for extracting good performances\n",
      "Review 1471: The story is extremely engaging. For those who enjoy suspense thrillers, it is a must watch. People interested in philosophy will find a lot of questions that need to be answered. The thin line between right and wrong, morality and immorality is questioned in this series. The plot is meticulously written, although the part where complex programmes designed by a supergenious are breached in no time seems impractical, but such liberty can be taken when such story is to be presented. When it comes to acting part, the cast does an excellent job. Arshad Warsi is phenomenal. The child artist also brings out the positivity. All the supporting cast members do their job nicely. You won't be disappointed, for sure.\n",
      "Review 1472: It's An addictive Web series like Sacred Games, Mirzapur. Blowed my mind\n",
      "Review 1473: Lovely blend of Indian mythology and edge on the seat thriller. I was in no mood of watching this but i didn't read one negative review, which compelled me to watch it. And it was a worth a watch. Brilliant acting. Excellent story. Every thing was worth it. Eagerly waiting for the second season.\n",
      "Review 1474: Arshad's brilliance to be showered on the screen . YOU WILL SURELY LOVE IT...AS WELL AS WILL YOUR FAMILY!!\n",
      "Review 1475: Asur id the most disappointing web series that i have ever watched. The plot is awful, a complete non sense and a waste of time. I strongly recommend not to watch.\n",
      "Review 1476: This series is just so thrilling that you would want it to finish in one go.Ignore the negative reviews, trust me,this is one of the greatest Tv series that I have seen in the last a few years.\n",
      "Review 1477: Everyone who worked on it wanted it to be outstanding. We must appreciate Gaurav Shukla for his intelligent and well-written essay. Thank you to NirenBhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the incredible crew. I'mwaiting for my next assignment. The concept is lovely. I was relieved to see Arsad Warsi in a film again after what seemed like an eternity. It's incredible that a scheme incorporating two parallel universes against evil can work. I was very excited to see this film before I ever saw the trailer. Asur is more than a crime thriller about forensic scientists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti on the hunt for a serial murderer. It forces us to reconsider our guiding values and the implications of our decisions under tremendous stress.\n",
      "Review 1478: Outstanding web series. Maybe first indian web series of its kind. It shows the connection between mythology with current world. Great Great Great to watch. Amazing background sound.But i am not satisfy with the Ending. The ending should havebeen better.\n",

      "Review 1483: No doubt its a smooth story with some great suspense. And you must watch\n",
      "Review 1484: This show has the right amount of funny, and the right amount of edgy action, just as it should be. Arshad warsi is a one man showman, owns every scene he is in, which is most scenes.\n",
      "Review 1485: Acting - 10/10 Direction - 10/10 Screenplay - 10/10 Best Indian espionage thriller till date hands down. It's worth investing your 500 min to this series, you will not be disappointed. It's a gripping series. The effort put in by everyone involved in this series can be easily seen. Keep up the good work Voot. Loving this OTT competition.\n",
      "Review 1486: I have no words to describe this movies. It's amazing and masterpiece.\n",
      "Review 1487: An awesome acting from Riddhi Donga with gorgeous story line.\n",
      "Review 1488: Finally, a director, set of incredible actors and technicians have delivered something that can ensure our credibility in cinema making as top-notch. The incredible research of Indian mythology, placement of real forensic science was simply awesome. If the dialogues weren't in Hindi... I would have refused to believe it's created by Indian team.\n",

      "Review 1492: There must be real talents working hard behind the scenes for this web series. It deserves to be a blockbuster. Go and watch with your family.\n",
      "Review 1493: It is very well written, absolutely thrilling web series. There are very less creation which keeps you glued till the end. This is one of them. This is one of the best script I have seen in recent times for Indian audience.It comes off with a great start and finishes off in an unimaginable way (I feel like, that could have been more better). I can easily say that acting is on par with the script especially the main characters.On a side note: Please watch these guys hacking India's one of the most secured server using GeeksForGeeks print triangle java code(Including Java comments to identify the program) in couple of last episodes.\n",

      "Review 1521: It was awesome hindi web series, this type of murder thriller even I didn't watch in English series also. Ya some small things need to correct as always crime happened & nobody can't do anything. But rest all things are very well done. I have finished this web series in single go. Even I was very tired but I can't able to close my eyes without completing it. Direction is very good, story writing awesome, each character acting was superb. Murder mystery was amazing. Combination of new technology & hindu mythology was near to perfect. I must say to everyone it's must watch web series. I was waiting since 2020 for its 2nd part.\n",

      "Review 1524: Arshad Warsi has played his character very well, I thought before watching the series that Arshad Warsi's character would be a comic character as he always does but I was wrong. Arshad Warsi has played his character so well that you will not believe that this is the circuit in Munna Bhai. Well the web series is very thrill and full of suspense. I am sure that if you watch it then you will fall in love with this series.\n",

      "Review 1535: This is the web series that puts a smile on your face as you watch it. You get in love with each and every character of the show. Specially with Arshad Varsi.\n",
      "Review 1536: First I thought that how the makers will take the famous actor in the second season, so that it will be known who is the real Asura. But such people were cast that hardly anyone knew. And there are 3 episodes of The Last One that pretty well redefined everything that happened in season one and season 2. Everyone has played their character very well and I have not seen such a good use of Hindu Mythology till date and hardly this type of use will be seen in future and even if it is found, it will be in very small quantity. It will be expected from all the directors that they also make series and movies on some good selected topics like this..\n",
      "Review 1537: Completed all episodes back to back, very well written and directed web series. Waiting for season 2\n",

The plot unravels with intriguing twists and turns, keeping the audience guessing and engaged. The production values are commendable, with high-quality cinematography and atmospheric music contributing to the overall immersive experience. \"Asur 2\" is a must-watch for fans of crime thrillers, as it successfully combines suspense, mystery, and a thought-provoking exploration of human psychology.\n",
      "Review 1540: Watched all 8 episodes of Asur 2 at one go, and I must say, they've made the most advanced crime thriller ever, based on mythology, advanced technology and human psychology. What impressed me the most are the facts, truths and realities shown in the film, the way mythology meets technology, and the philosophical beliefs of Kali. The makers have tried their best to keep everything real in this 7 hour fiction, which is a plus point. Performances are top notch, and Mr. Warsi has given his best. Proud of the entire team. They have delivered their best, an absolute masterpiece!*Highly Recommended.\n",

      "Review 1547: The show boasts of some terrific writing courtesy Gaurav Shukla, Niren Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal and the meticulous research on Hindu mythology and forensic science that has been done shows. It clearly states that research does not mean going through Wikipedia pages!\n",
      "Review 1548: I strongly feel that the wriers have done excellent job in terms of research and knowledge of mythology. 10 out of 10 for Writers and Dialogue. You can put aside everything and just watch for the mythological dialogues.\n",
      "Review 1549: Remember watching Jab Tak Hai Jaan FDFS and telling my friend what a wonderful performer sharib hashmi is. Filmistaan and his subsequent work in other films/show (TFM) made me a fan and he delivers yet another stellar performance in Asur.\n",
      "Review 1550: Barun Sobti is a charmer but in this show, he underplays that aspect of his personality and brings a troubled character to the fore wonderfully. No spoilers but do watch out for the way he has enacted scene.\n",

      "Review 1555: The way Indian content comes up you can now see what grassroots can provide you if you have pure content like this. Just unbelievable....the way every character shows his impact is just incredible. Very few series like this creates inner impact for longer time. Happy that Indian contents and directors are now actually growing towards right direction. Hats of to all the cast, crew, and each and every person associated with this.A must watch game. You never want to miss. It is not just a treat to watch but much more to think deeply in every move of your life.Well done dear team AasurCan't wait for season 3.\n",
      "Review 1556: I love suspense series and it's best one , every scene is perfect and you hooked up with your screen to know what will happen next.. enjoyable\n",
      "Review 1557: This is a terrible, illogical, nonsensical show. You will figure out who the \"bad guy\" is by episode 2 or 3 but the writers assume that they make a big reveal in the last episode. Full disclosure: We only watched episodes 1-3 and 8. Horrible.\n",
      "Review 1558: Asur is the best Indian web series for audience who love to watch thriller and suspense.Plot of the series is just awesome and very unique from any other show today. All the characters are on to the point and have brilliant performance, but special mention to the child actor who played the role of Shub Joshi, the main villian in the show. His acting is just spectacular. His Hindi pronunciation and and facial expressions really gave goosebumps. Even the music deserves praise, it gave that ancient mythological feel with seriousness.I recommend everyone to watch these show you won't regret watching it.\n",

      "Review 1561: Very well written story and must say execution is up to the mark . Shades of personality is really amazing. A good series with lot's of twist and turns.\n",
      "Review 1562: The second season of Asur is a masterclass in suspense. Although all of the actors are superb, Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti deliver the most remarkable performances. The plot is enthralling and fast-paced, leaving the reader puzzled until the very end. The programme skilfully combines scientific fact and primordial myth. The author's use of the Vedas and other ancient texts to shed light on the serial killer's mind is both intriguing and disquieting. The series also examines the possibility that AI could be used for malevolent purposes.

      "Review 1567: The story itself is really good and gripping, great performance by actors. I guess I will still consider mirzapur or sacred game season 1 better than this, because of mediocre direction and editing. I am pretty sure, that a more experienced director would have made this same show in much better way.And the second thing is the sound. For webseries like this, one must have a better sound design.\n",

The series' remarkable storyline is highlighted by the excellent consistency from episode to episode and the diverse characters. The series serves as a sobering reminder of the far-reaching consequences of modern conflict by exposing its fatal ramifications. More shows of this type should be produced on the internet by the film business. So, please, please, please, Season 3 of this programme as soon as possible. Because to Arshad Warsi's mesmerising acting, the series has an intriguing protagonist, and the dialogue is also excellent.\n",

There are some scenes where you might find it stupid and will look like its written by a kid. They made it so predictable. Ending was also stupid. I see only kids liking it and those who are new into thrillers. Thank you.\n",

      "Review 1591: Instead, the actors, director, and music. It's undeniably worth your time to check out. Season 2 can't come soon enough! Now that I've seen the entire season, I can confidently describe this show. Having witnessed the performance, I can say that it is without a doubt of the highest quality. This film, which has been described as \"spellbinding,\" \"interesting,\" \"thought-provoking,\" and \"incredible and mind-blowing,\" must be seen not just in India but all around the world. The creator and writer, Gaurav Shukla, has done a lot. Under the capable guidance of Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal, along with Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh, delivered excellent results. If you see the show, it will stay with you forever. Season 2 of the programme has my undivided attention.\n",
      "Review 1592: Among the loveliest Bollywood films ever produced, in my opinion. Arshad Warsi, one of my favourite actors, has piqued my interest in season two of SOBTI BARUN. I've been waiting for a web series like this, and it hasn't let me down. I cannot wait to view more Bollywood films and television programmes. My interest in Bollywood has been piqued; I usually watch American television. I'm compelled to reveal a spoiler, but I won't because it's art and you should see it. This is much more than merely a captivating read. This is a mental stimulation exercise. Around the middle of the series, the narrative thickens significantly and your interest reaches its apex. You may refer to this programme as a \"psychological thriller\" since that is precisely what it is.\n",
      "Review 1593: Everyone gave it their all to make it a night to remember. Gaurav Shukla, I admire your amazing literary effort. Please also convey my best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the crew. I can't wait to get started on the next project. This is an excellent concept. It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi in a film after such a long period. The idea of two worlds banding together to battle a shared foe is fantastic. Without seeing a trailer, the bio was enough to persuade me to watch it. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti's narrative, about two forensic professionals on the hunt for the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur, is more than a crime thriller. All ofour goals, beliefs, and values, as well as our behaviour in the face of hardship, are put into question.\n",
      "Review 1594: The second season of Asur is exactly as intriguing as the first. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti both provide fantastic performances. The plot moves quickly, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The show seamlessly blends legend and contemporary. The killer's use of the Vedas and other old traditions to explain his or her acts is both interesting and terrifying. It combines mythology with technology; it investigates the perils of artificial intelligence and how it might be used for evil; it has outstanding acting; a well-paced tale; intense tension; and it will make you think. There are various plot flaws, and the visual effects aren't always impressiveimpressive.\n",
      "Review 1595: Asur's talents as a performer defies categorisation. A fleeting gaze, yet such depth of emotion expressed. Intelligent forensics specialist became family guy; devoted father and husband; married to a Scary Asur with whom he suffers emotionally. This was a fantastic example of the suspense genre. The writing keeps your interest throughout the film. The background music, produced and performed by Bickram Ghosh, was magnificent. The final scene with the background music gave me shivers. I finished watching Asur a few days ago. Mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology were all thoroughly explored, and the subtle relationships between them in the creation of this masterpiece are nothing short of genius. Congratulations to everyone on the cast and crew! Every second of it was enjoyable for me.\n",
      "Review 1596: Totally loved the entire season of Asur On Voot in one go.\n",
      "Review 1597: I don't understand why they write bad reviews about a good TV series. Sad part is most of the people decide even before watching it just by looking at these reviews You should watch this series and I am sure you gonna love it\n",

      "Review 1628: I will definitely say this is masterclass by Indian actors. Storyline is so good that you can't sleep if you started in evening. Very very addictive. Every character is good. Dark character is very strong and that is forte of this series . You keep guessing and this series will make you feel like you are watching a masterclass. However inbetween story becomes a bit slow but altogether . It's a must must watch.\n",
      "Review 1629: This web series has been meticulously constructed to captivate its audience and draw them into the story's many complexities. The extraordinary narrative abilities of the show are on display in the nuanced portrayal of multiple characters and the consistent linking of plotlines across episodes. The show's depiction of technological warfare's devastation is a sobering reminder of the far-reaching consequences of such conflict. The film industry needs to produce additional web series with scripts of this calibre. Therefore, I implore the producers to expedite Season 3 production. Although the script could use some work, Arshad Warsi's hypnotic performance as the protagonist saves the series.\n",
      "Review 1630: Arshad Warsi, you must put a stop to this. The film has a brilliant premise and is expertly directed. Each and every actor delivered an outstanding performance. Asur, the greatest ever Hindi web series, has now concluded. It combines scientific enquiry and Hindu principles. Wow, fantastic work, pal! When will a sequel be released? This year, every award will go to Asur. This web series has received a perfect score of 10 out of 10 in every category, including acting, production, and story. And to think that I just completed... Now that I am aware that all episodes will ultimately be made available, I intend to view the show. They were discarded on Saturday. I haven't gotten over it yet... Where does Kali originate? Will it ever cease? The author's excellent use of language will leave you pondering what will happen next. Creators and publishers, I'm imploring that you don't take too long.\n",
      "Review 1631: Lacks logic. Bad climax.Lacks logic. Bad climax.Lacks logic. Bad climax.\n",
      "Review 1632: This programme marks out for its absence of offensive language and sexual content. It's perfect for a family night in. The 7-8 hours you devote to this programme will be well spent. In summation, both the performances and cinematography are of the highest quality. The entire series is flawless in every respect. Not only is Asur a popular programme, but it also deserves its high ratings. I have a severe case of Asur hangover, and I cannot identify a single flaw in this. Both the opening and closing tracks are eerie. I cannot stop thinking about it. It truly ranks among the greatest performances I've ever witnessed. The writing, direction, and acting are all extremely impressive. Asur was viewed in a single session. I've never completed a Web series in a single sitting. Finally, a programme that can intellectually contend with the West. I appreciate you making available this excellent series.\n",
      "Review 1633: Never seen before like this series'. Good concept & story line. Best timing & thrilled in series'. Actors are very good. Arshad Warsi's best performance in career\n",

      "Review 1636: 1. Can anyone tell how audity jalan was killed? The autopsy said poison through drinking but everything was tested. Yes snake poison can insert through vein but it takes time to kill.2. Are you serious that you shot two police officers and no one cares?3. You are dealing with serial killer and Your one of CBI officer shot dead while two are officially sent. Hilariously another attend the funeral. I mean how??\n",
      "Review 1637: And in this high-tech, scientific world where we are getting more isolated and lonely, are we more likely to fall prey to those who appear nice and logical but who really only want to exert power over you and control your views and beliefs? A few intense action scenes situated on the brink of life and death leave viewers on edge. The hero is the centre of attention as he investigates horrible fatalities in aesthetically spectacular and exotic locations in a series of sequences that play out in rapid succession. This is a fantastic piece of writing. For fans of the Thriller series, this is a must-see. After viewing the entire season, I feel confident providing a summary of this show. FANTASTICALLY MAGICAL AND INTERESTING AND PROVOKING THOUGHTS.\n",
      "Review 1638: \"asur\" means \"evil\" in Arabic, and the series' title alludes to the psychological origins of evil. Priorities fluctuate over time. How far your inner assailant will go to protect you. Your viewpoint may be correct for you, but incorrect for others. A horrifying tale that is skilfully constructed. There are a total of eight episodes, and the intrigue progressively builds throughout. The entire production, from the writing to the performances, blew me away. The combined effort is phenomenal. Not to be overlooked. Oh my God!! Suffices in and of itself. What a sequence of occurrences, huh? This is an excellent initial measure for Voot choose. The United States has never before broadcast a similar Indian television programme. Everything about it was superb, including the writing, direction, and acting. It is the ideal combination of mystery and legend.\n",

      "Review 1640: Alternatively, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly something you ought to see. We eagerly anticipate Season 2! After viewing the entire season of this programme, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language. Having witnessed the performance, I can say with confidence that it is of the highest calibre and standard. It must be screened worldwide, not just in India. The founder and author, Gaurav Shukla, has accomplished a great deal. Under the capable direction of Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh performed outstanding work, as did NirenH. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The programme will leave an indelible mark on your psyche if you watch it. The second season of the programme has my complete attention.\n",
      "Review 1641: Asur is a well written and executed thriller series. After a shadowy start each episode will drag you to dramatic hook. The story starts with Nikhil who ditches his top- notch job in America and joins CBI to solve a mysterious case and catch a serial killer. It's a eight episodic drama which will create a mysterious atmosphere around you and create a hell lot confusion. It's a gripping story which will keep you intact to your seats till the end. The story keeps unfolding with frequent twists and the central theme is family.\n",
      "Review 1642: Acting+story+presentation all are amazing.Story is not only unique but suspense was very creative.\n",
      "Review 1643: The script, performances, narration, visuals, and sound design all work together to create an unforgettable experience. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, AnupriyaGoenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, MeiyangChang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra have all given excellent performances. The award will go to a programme that deserves it. This programme will have you questioning your own sense of what is good and wrong in the world. This show has gone to unusual lengths to combine mythical and futuristic aspects. Highly recommended... give it a go, and by all means, anticipate season 3 with tremendous enthusiasm. The shocking plot twists in this suspenseful novel will keep you wondering right up to the final page. The trailer does not do justice to the film. It's has a fantastic soundtrack, a well-developed story, and elements from the fields of mythology, psychology, and forensics. It is emphatically suggested.\n",
      "Review 1644: The narrative, acting, narration, graphics, and sound design all contribute to the incredible nature of this programme. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, AnupriyaGoenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, MeiyangChang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra have given the best performances. This programme merits the award, and it will receive it. It's the type of programme that makes you question whether your preconceived notions of right and evil are accurate. This series has made extraordinary efforts to incorporate futuristic and mythological elements. Strongly recommended...check it out, and by all means anticipate the third season with tremendous anticipation. This mind-boggling suspense novel will keep you pondering until the very end. The trailer does not do justice to the film. It has mythology, psychology, forensics, a wonderful score, and a well-developed narrative. Unquestionably recommended.\n",
      "Review 1645: You ended it, Arshad Warsi. It's well plotted and directed. Each and every one of the actors was superb in their respective parts. I recently completed Asur, the finest Hindi web series to merge scientific enquiry with Hindu tenet. Well done, buddy! I can't wait for the next installment! Asur will win every honour this year. The acting, production value, and story of this web series are all worthy of a perfect score of 10 out of 10. What the heck have I done... I plan on watching this once all the episodes are out, and would you believe it? They came out last Friday or Saturday. I haven't gotten over it yet... Where does Kali come from? When is this going to end? Subtle literary techniques will have you guessing at the ending. Creators and publishers taking too much time is a major concern of mine.\n",
      "Review 1646: This web series was clearly made with great care, as its complex plot readily draws in viewers. The series' remarkable narrative talent is on display in the vivid portrayal of various characters and the consistent continuity across episodes. The show's depiction of the destruction caused by technological warfare serves as a sobering warning of the far-reaching implications of such conflict. More high-quality screenplays like this should be used to create web series in the film business. Therefore, I beg the producers to hurry up and make Season 3. Arshad Warsi's spellbinding performance as the protagonist is a major contributor to the show's mysterious atmosphere, and the language is also excellent.\n",
      "Review 1647: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDING INTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The concert will forever remain in your memory. I eagerly anticipate the second season.\n",
      "Review 1648: I watched it because of the hype that was created. Its good journey for a thriller lover, but there was many plot holes & looseends.A show started well but ending was flawed. Story including mythology was good enough but the poor acting is the major downside of the series.Don't take me worngs, Its still better than current many bollywood movies. If u r a thrill lover then u should go for it, otherwise u will end with disappointment.\n",
      "Review 1649: The show is outstanding due to its outstanding cast, narrative, structure, visuals, soundtrack, and plot. Everyone has been phenomenal, including Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra. This performance will take the award without a doubt. A performance such as this may cause you to challenge your presumptions. Regarding the blending of mythology and technology, this series has delved deep. It comes with my highest recommendation; you should read it. A breathtaking suspense novel that will keep you pondering until the very last page. The trailer does not do credit to the film. The film has everything: mythology, psychology, forensics, exceptional soundtrack, and a well-developed plot. You should not pass up this opportunity.\n",
      "Review 1650: You are absolutely correct, Mr. Warsi. The concept is brilliant, and its execution is flawless. Everyone did an excellent job assuming their respective roles. Asur, the best Hindi web series, does an excellent job of bridging Hindu spiritual themes with scientific ones. I was unable to set it down, and I eagerly anticipate the next installment. This year, Asur will obtain every accolade bestowed. In terms of acting, direction, and plot, I assign the greatest web series ever a perfect score of 10 out of 10. I cannot believe that just occurred. This weekend, when all the episodes are available (they were recorded on the weekend, which is opportune for me), I'll give it a try. Still processing the unexpected shock... Please explain who Kali is to me. How widespread is this issue, precisely? The best literary works keep their readers until thaan.lantn.\n",
      "Review 1651: This wonderfully constructed web series captivates its audience right away, drawing them deep into the story's numerous levels. The seamless link between episodes and the exceptional characterisation of many characters demonstrate the series' tremendous narrative skill. The series serves as a grim reminder of contemporary warfare's far-reaching effect by illustrating its lethal repercussions. More superbly created online programmes of this calibre should be produced by the film industry. As a result, I respectfully beg that Season 3 be completed as soon as feasible. Arshad Warsi's fascinating lead performance gives the series an interesting character, and the language is terrific.\n",
      "Review 1652: If you have watched The Mentalist season then this is an inspired version of Mentalist with Indian touch. Very good story line but the decisions taken by characters are clumsy.\n",
      "Review 1653: Or the musicians, actresses, and filmmakers. Definitely worth a look. Season 2 piques my interest. After watching the full season, I'd want to characterise this programme in a few terms. INTRIGUING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING SPELLBINDING I can say with sure that the programme is top-notch and world-class after seeing it. It must be shown to the entire globe, not only Indian audiences. Gaurav Shukla and his team of writers performed an outstanding job. Oni Sen's directing is superb, thanks to Vinay Chhawal and Niren H Bhatt. Outstanding performances are given by Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, SharibHashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh. The show will leave you with long-lasting impressions. I'm excited for the second season.\n",
      "Review 1654: In the moment where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a character, there is an editing issue. Everything about Asur is excellent, especially the writing, which had me wondering till the very end. I've seen every Asur episode. It's incredible. It's a little slow at times, but it helps you understand the narrative and Indian mythology. As a result, it didn't worry me. After a long time, I finally saw a thrilling Hindi programming that lasted to the conclusion. For the audience and supporters, Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur, this time on a digital screen. Fantastic picture with a fantastic storyline and direction. The timing of all of the performers' actions is perfect. Everyone involved did everything they could to make it memorable. Thank you for this great work of literary art, Gaurav Shukla. Congratulations to NirenBhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team as well. I'm excited about the next project.\n",
      "Review 1655: The performance of Asur cannot be described in a single term. Simple single-gaze, yet extremely profound emotions conveyed with simplicity. Intelligent forensic specialist to a family man, a devoted father and spouse to a Fearsome Asur with whom he struggles emotionally. This was an excellent suspense novel. Throughout the duration of the film, the script maintains your intrigue. Bickram Ghosh did a wonderful job with the background music, which I found to be quite beautiful. I felt shivers during the final instant of the background music. I have just completed watching Asur. The research on mythology,astrology, science, and psychology, as well as how well it has all been integrated to create and execute this masterpiece, is phenomenal; congratulations to the entire team, cast, and personnel! I enjoyed every seen.\n",
      "Review 1656: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torture another individual. Asur's writing is superb on its own and kept me guessing until the very end. The entire first season of Asur was viewed in a single session. That is remarkable. The slower than usual tempo facilitates the reader's understanding of the central Indian mythology and culture. I had absolutely no complaints because of this. A relief was a Hindi suspense that held my attention until the very end. Those who admire Asur's previous films will appreciate Arshad Warsi's return. The plot and direction of this film are both outstanding. The entire ensemble has impeccable coordination. Everyone who.\n",
      "Review 1657: Asur 2 is the pinnacle of tension, with each episode revealing new details about the cunning villen descendants who continue to con Dhanjay rajpoot and his crew. Arshad Warsi's portrayal of the well-developed character was outstanding. Varun Arora and Amey wagh are in identical circumstances. The use of artificial intelligence to analyse and predict user activity is a seamless addition to the show's established narrative. Starcast as a whole has been a triumph, but the narrative is unnecessarily drawn out until the eighth episode. If the episodes were reduced more effectively, the show may have lasted longer than its first season. Compilation of Anupriya Goenka's Hacking Scenes During the brief 30-minute session, she will (ironically) execute applications designed for computer geeks.\n",
      "Review 1658: Asur's performance cannot be summed up in a single phrase. It is simple to convey enormous feelings with a single, simple expression. Intelligent forensic specialist to family guy, devoted father and married to a Fearsome Asur with whom he is emotionally conflicted. This was an incredible suspense novel. The storyline keeps your attention throughout the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the background music, which I enjoyed. I got chills during the closing scene with this BGM. I just finished watching Asur. It's astonishing how beautifully mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research has been interwoven into the development and execution of this masterwork - congratulations to the whole team, actors, and employees! I loved every word!\n",
      "Review 1659: This is one of the finest Bollywood films have ever seen. Amazing acting abilities My personal preference DR. BARUN SOBTI This has been the best web series I've seen in a while. I am a fan of Hollywood web series, but this has made me eager for Bollywood content. I also hope the next season comes with the same perfection and excellence. Please view it; it's a work of art. This contains no spoilers, although I'm compelled to tell you one. This exceeds the definition of a suspense. It tricks the psyche. At the midpoint of the series, the narrative develops beautifully and leaves the reader wanting more! This programme is a genuine \"psychological thriller\"\n",
      "Review 1660: Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment. The concept is extremely beautiful. It was great to see Arsad Warsi on television again after so long. Incredible is the concept of two universes and their struggle against evil. I chose to watch the movie despite not having seen the trailer. Asur is more than a straightforward crime thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a cat-and-mouse game in quest of the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur. It causes us to doubt our morals, beliefs, and values at various junctures, as well as the decisions we make in extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 1661: Or the Artists (the people who create things like movies and plays). You should definitely set aside some time for this. Expectations for the forthcoming second season are sky-high. Now that I've seen the entire season, I feel prepared to provide an analysis on the programme. I can state without reservation that it was one of the finest live performances I have ever witnessed, anywhere in the world, because I was there to witness it. The film has to open in theatres throughout the world, not only India. The work of inventor and author Gaurav Shukla is outstanding. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh give unforgettable performances in Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal's concert, which is wonderfully directed by Oni Sen.\n",
      "Review 1662: This is one of the finest Bollywood films I have ever seen. Amazing acting abilities My personal preference DR. BARUN SOBTI This has been the best web series I've seen in a while. I am a fan of Hollywood web series, but this has made me eager for Bollywood content. I also hope the next season comes with the same perfection and excellence. Please view it; it's a work of art. This contains no spoilers, although I'm compelled to tell you one. This exceeds the definition of a suspense. It tricks the psyche. At the midpoint of the series, the narrative develops beautifully and leaves the reader wanting more! This programme.\n",
      "Review 1663: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything about Asur is superb, but the writing in particular kept me guessing until the very end. I've seen every Asur episode. It is remarkable. It is occasionally a bit sluggish, but it aids comprehension of the narrative and Indian mythology. As a consequence, I was unconcerned. I eventually witnessed a riveting Hindi programme that endured to its conclusion after a lengthy wait. This time, Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur on a digital projection for the audience and supporters. Fantastic film with an excellent plot and execution. All of the performers' actions are perfectly timed. Everyone involved did their utmost to make the event memorable. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to.\n",
      "Review 1664: Everyone involved worked hard to make the event a success. Gaurav Shukla deserves special recognition for the superb writing he delivered. In addition, I'd like to commend Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team for their outstanding work. Now I'm looking forwards to my next task. The concept is just stunning. It was fantastic to see Arsad Warsi on television after such a long time. The notion of two universes and their battle against evil is incredible. Despite not having watched the trailer, I decided to see the film. Asur is more than just a simple criminal thriller in which forensic experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti play a cat-and-mouse game in search of the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur. It leads us to question our morals, beliefs, and values at certain points, as well as the judgements we make in severe and difficult situations.\n",
      "Review 1665: This masterfully designed web series instantly captivates its audience, dragging them deep into the narrative's many layers. The series' great storytelling talent is seen by the seamless link between episodes and the superb characteriszation of multiple characters. By demonstrating the deadly consequences of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching influence. The film business must make more brilliantly crafted web shows of this kind. As a result, I humbly request that the creators create Season 3 as soon as possible. Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance in the lead part lends the series an intriguing character, and the dialogue is superb.\n",
      "Review 1666: Having viewed the performance, I can say with some assurance that it is of the highest quality and calibre. It must be exhibited to the entire globe, and not just to Indian audiences. Excellent achievement by the creator and authors Gaurav Shukla. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The Series is packed with Suspense. Every Minute and Second, you wonder what will transpire next. Excellent introduction to the Psycho personality. This series appealed to me immediately upon my first sight of it. It is utterly mind-boggling, and the story's premise is both intriguing and confusing, which makes the web series even more intriguing. I always recommend this incredibly incredible web series to my friends, and I also enjoy viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 1667: Everyone involved did their utmost to make the event memorable. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to the next endeavour. The concept is brilliant. It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi on film again after a lengthy absence. Wonderful is the concept of two planets confronting an evil aspect. I viewed it without viewing the trailer due to the bio. Asur is more than just a criminal thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti pursue a self-proclaimed serial murderer, Asur. It compels us to reevaluate our principles, beliefs, and values at various points in our lives, as well as the decisions we make.\n",
      "Review 1668: The second season of Asur is awell-crafted and intriguing drama. The performances are exceptional, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti particularly standing out. The narrative moves quickly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series does an excellent job of incorporating mythology and technology. The use of the Vedas and other ancient religions to explain the killer's motives is both fascinating and ominous. The series also examines the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it can be used for evil... Here are some of the series' advantages and disadvantages: Pros: *Excellent acting *Well-paced story *Thrilling suspense *Thought-provoking It combines mythology and technology. Some of the visual effects are inferior.\n",
      "Review 1669: Before viewing this online series, I believed that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon were the finest Indian web series. This is no longer the case, as Voot has crowned ASUR the greatest web series produced in India to date. This is \"The Very Best,\" and it is believable, evil, and disturbing. You will not be able to move from your positions. There are no significant promotions for Voot select or Web series. But believe me when I say it is a jewel, unadulterated gold, in the culture of Indian television and web series. Never before have I written such this is the very best movie.\n",
      "Review 1670: Absolutely spot on, Arshad Warsi. It has a fantastic plot and is expertly handled. Everyone in the cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective roles. Asur, the finest online series in Hindi, successfully combines scientific and Hindu philosophical concepts. I loved it and can't wait for the next installment. This year, Asur will take home every honour possible. The best acting, best direction, and best plot line all add up to a web series that deserves a perfect score of 10 out of 10. I can't believe what I just finished. I'll give it a shot on the weekend when all the episodes are out, which is convenient because that's when they filmed it. The shock hasn't worn off yet... Explain who or what Kali is. How long will this last? Well-written works keep readers guessing until the very end. Let's only hope the production and publication processes don't drag on for too long.\n",
      "Review 1671: Asur 2 is the epitome of mythological suspense, keeping you on the edge of your seat with each new episode's revelations about the wily genuinues of villen who keep fooling Dhanjay rajpoot and his gang. Arshad Warsi did a great job portraying the well-written character. The same applies to Amey wagh and Varun Arora. The legendary plot and the concept on which the programme is built (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) are a seamless fit. The rest of the Starcast has also done a good job, however the tale drags on unnecessarily until episode 8. This programme may have ended after the first season if the editing had been better. Anupriya Goenka's Hacking Scenes, Collected The programme will only be 30 minutes long, and she will be (jokingly) executing codes written by geeks for geeks.\n",
      "Review 1672: It's an incredible show because of the acting, writing, structuring, aesthetics, music, and, yeah, narrative. All the actors-from Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti to Anupriya Goenka and Abhishek Chauhan and Ridhi Dogra and Meiyang Chang and Amey Wagh and Pawan Chopra-have done a fantastic job. There is no doubt that this show will take home the prise. It's the kind of show that might have you wondering whether or not the things you take for granted are actually correct. This series has gone far below the surface in its integration of mythology and technology. I can't say enough good things about it; you should definitely check it out. A mind-blowing suspense thriller that has you wondering till the very end. The preview does not do the film credit. Mythology, psychology, forensics, excellent score, and a well-thought-out script. There's a chance you shouldn't pass up.\n",
      "Review 1673: Everybody did their absolute best to make the event a huge success. What you've written is excellent; please keep it up, Gaurav Shukla. I also hope that Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team have as much success as they deserve. I can't wait to get into the next project. Wow, that's a great idea. Seeing Arsad Warsi in a movie again after such a lengthy absence was a treat. The notion of two planets joining forces to take on a common enemy is amazing. The bio had me interested in viewing the film even before I saw a teaser. More than merely a thriller, Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti's story follows two forensic experts as they track down the accused serial killer Asur. What we desire, what we believe, what we value, and what we do when faced with adversity are all put to the test.\n",
      "Review 1674: If you enjoyed the first season of Asur, you will love the second. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti produce outstanding performances. The story's rapid progression will keep you wondering until the very end. There is no jarring transition between the mythology and the present day throughout the performance. The fact that the offender is using ancient texts like the Vedas to justify their actions is both fascinating and terrifying. It fuses mythology and technology, explores the dangers of AI, and boasts top-notch acting, a finely paced story, high stakes, and an atmosphere that is sure to provoke thought in its viewers. The plot has a number of holes, and the special effects are usually lacklustre.\n",
      "Review 1675: This beautifully crafted web series immediately captivates its audience, bringing them deeply into the story's multiple levels. The seamless connection between episodes and the exceptional characterisation of numerous characters exemplify the series' exceptional storytelling ability. The series functions as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of modern warfare by depicting its lethal consequences. The film industry should produce a greater quantity of online programming of this calibre. Therefore, I respectfully request that Season 3 be concluded as quickly as possible. The language is excellent, and the main performance by Arshad Warsi lends the series a compelling character.\n",
      "Review 1676: You have hit the target on the head, Mr. Warsi. It is a fantastic story that is also expertly directed. Congratulations to all of the characters, who all performed admirably. Asur, the finest Hindi web series in terms of science and Hindu philosophy, recently concluded. I'm looking forwards to the second installment. Outstanding effort, gentleman. This year, Asur will obtain every prise. This web series receives a perfect score due to its excellent acting, direction, and storyline. What did I just say... Guess what they did over the weekend? I'm not over it yet... What precisely is Kali's identity? When will this be over? Intelligent writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the time required by artists and publishers is not excessive.\n",

      "Review 1678: Alternately, the actors, the rector, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDING INTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The concert will forever remain in your memory. I eagerly anticipate the second season.\n",
      "Review 1679: Previously, I had considered the first seasons of Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon to be the finest Indian online series. Voot claims that ASUR is the greatest Indian web series ever produced. As implied by the title, \"The Very Best\" is a realistic, brutal, and terrifying piece of writing. You will be unable to abandon your posts. Neither Voot select nor this web series contain significant advertisements. However, take it from me, it is unadulterated treasure in terms of Indian web series and television culture. Never before have I given a web series or film such a glowing review. It'swonderful to see Indian film and television progress. Talented actors have always been a part of our profession, but story is gaining importance as well. The quality of our content is also improving. In conclusion, only one word: phenomenal.\n",
      "Review 1680: This web series is so well-made that it immediately captivates viewers and draws them into its intricate plot. The exceptional continuity from episode to episode and the multidimensionality of the characters highlight the exceptional narrative of the series. By depicting contemporary warfare's lethal repercussions, the series functions as a sombre reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry should produce more internet programmes of this calibre. Please release Season 3 of this programme as soon as it is humanly possible. The series has a captivating protagonist due to Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance, and the dialogue is also excellent.\n",
      "Review 1681: The complexity of Asur's performance cannot be wrapped up in a single term. Certain individuals are naturals at expressing complex emotions with only a glance. Intelligent forensics expert-turned-family man struggling emotionally with his fearsome Asur wife and small children. This suspenseful page-turner left me disoriented. The script maintains the audience's interest throughout. The composition and performance of Bickram Ghosh's score was one of my finest aspects of the entire experience. The final scene accompanied by this background music gave me goosebumps. Just finished viewing Asur. Mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology all play significant roles in the creation and presentation of this masterpiece; congratulations to all involved! I drank in every syllable!\n",
      "Review 1682: This show is unlike any other because it avoids vulgar language and focuses solely on the plot. You and your loved ones may enjoy yourselves. Seven to eight hours of your time will not be squandered by watching this series. Finally, the performances and camerawork are of the highest calibre. There is not a solitary error in this entire series. Asur is a renowned programme due to its high quality. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover, but I couldn't identify a single flaw in this. The opening and concluding compositions both feature foreboding music. It has been ingrained in my mind. I can confidently state that this is one of the greatest concerts I have ever witnessed. I cannot express enough praise for the script, direction, and acting. I viewed the totality of Asur in one day. My viewership of two Web series in a single day is unprecedented. Finally, a programme that can intellectually contend with western entertainment. I appreciate you producing a series of such high calibre.\n",
      "Review 1683: The scene in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriyatorment another character was tarnished by an editing error. The writing in Asur is superb; I was kept guessing until the very end. I have witnessed the totality of Asur. I believe it's fantastic. Slow at times, but valuable for learning about Indian mythology and the fundamental themes of the story. I therefore experienced no distress. After a lengthy delay, I was able to view an intriguing and suspenseful Hindi thriller. In consideration of the audience and the admirers, Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur, this time on a digital screen. This film's script and production are excellent. Movements of the actors are perfectly timed. Everyone exerted their utmost effort to make the evening memorable. I admire the quality of your literary work, Gaurav Shukla. Please also convey my best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I am anxious to begin the next assignment.\n",
      "Review 1684: Not to mention the singers, directors, and performers. The show merits your attention. Season 2 piques my interest. After viewing the entire season, I feel qualified to provide a summary of this programme. After observing the programme, I can state with confidence that it is of the highest quality and calibre. It is captivating, intriguing, astounding, mind-boggling, and thought-provoking. It must be viewed by individuals everywhere, not just in India. The work done by Gaurav Shukla and his writing team is excellent. Outstanding direction is provided by Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh deliver outstanding performances. The programme has a significant impact on viewers. The impending second season piques my interest.\n",
      "Review 1685: How susceptible are we to individuals who, on the surface, appear kind and rational but who, in reality, havetheir own agenda, power over you, and are willing to influence your ideas and thoughts in today's high-tech, scientific world, where we're becoming increasingly isolated and lonely? A few intense action sequences involving life and death lend an exotic element to the movie. The action transpires in a series of interconnected sequences centred on the protagonist, who is required to conduct body searches in foreign locales. Exceptional in form and function! A must-see for fans of suspense! After viewing the entire season of this programme, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language. STUNNING BREATHTAKING MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC.\n",
      "Review 1686: An editing issue exists in the scene in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torture another character. Asur is exceptional in every aspect; his writing alone had me wondering till the very end. I watched the entire first season of Asur in one sitting. That's incredible. A slower-than-average pacing allows for a more in-depth absorption in the story's Indian mythology and culture. That's why I didn't mind in the least. I was relieved to find a Hindi thriller that kept my interest to the very end. Fans of Arshad Warsi will be happy to see him reunited on screen with Asur. This film has a fantastic narrative and direction. Everyone onstage has impeccable timing. Everyone who worked on it wanted it to be outstanding. We must appreciate Gaurav Shukla for his intelligent and well-written essay. Thank you to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the incredible crew. I'm waiting for my next assignment.\n",
      "Review 1687: This masterfully constructed web series captivates its audience right away, immersing them in the story's various layers. The series' remarkable storytelling abilities is exemplified by the seamless link between episodes and the exceptional characteriszation of several characters. By illustrating the devastating results of modern conflict, the series serves as a grim reminder of the far-reaching ramifications of modern combat. The film business should develop more online content of this kind. As a result, I sincerely beg that Season 3 be completed as soon as feasible. The language is great, and Arshad Warsi's major performance gives the series a captivating character.\n",
      "Review 1688: The story and acting is good but apart from it what impressed me is the background music. Surely it will gonna be my ringtone from now onwards. This series has all tye drama and fun what viewer demands. So it worth giving time.\n",

      "Review 1704: I honestly had zero expectations from an Indian web series that was diving into a serial killer's mind.. but after seeing the reviews and watching the first episode (which is the best episode of the season), I watched the whole show in one day! My mind is blown and I keep thinking about the concept and how true it is.Asur hum sab mein hai.

Some scenes are stupid e.g. when DJ (Arshad Warsi) identified the next victim's name from the list of thousands of names within a minute. I mean at least show some struggle to find people. And what's the deal with Lolark? why he's stupid all the time. He's a CBI agent for god's sake. Also somebody teach Barun Sobti how to deliver dialogue. He just mumbles words in his mouth. I had to watch him again everytime he spoke to hear what he said.Hope next season you show some improvements.\n",

The script(though it has some flaws) keeps you engaged through out the movie.This movie is an epitome of bengali art and culture. And acting wise saying, Jeet has rediscovered himself as an actor, He reminds us about the mad artist Ramkinkar Baij, this is his best work till date, people who say he can't act should go and watch the film,And Nusrat too has given a stellar performance,and Aabir acting as a pro, not unusual for him! There were competition among these 3 that who will overshadow whom(acting wise)! And last but not the least the 'Background music', boy its just amazing, Bickram Ghosh has done an excellent job! The last seen with that BGM gave goosebumps really.\n",

      "Review 1848: After watching a few episodes, I can state without reservation that it is a very remarkable programme. People from all across the world, not just those in India, need to see it. The writing by Gaurav Shukla and his colleagues is excellent. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. The suspense in this show is palpable at all times. You don't let a single moment go by without worrying about anything in the future. This is a fantastic setting up of the insane personality. The first episode piqued my interest in the series.

However, in 2020, Asur has broken all the records and has taken the parameters of web series to the next level. Everything, from Acting to direction, was speculation of best.

      "Review 1852: Season 2 of Asur is a professionally made and harrowing drama. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti'sperformances stand out. The plot proceeds swiftly and keeps the reader puzzled until the conclusion. The series successfully combines mythology and science fiction. It is both fascinating and unsettling that references to the Vedas and other ancient texts explain the killer's motives.

      "Review 1868: An absolute masterwork of Bollywood film. I can'twait for season two because of the fantastic performances, especially from BARUN SOBTI, and because this is Arshad Warsi at his best. There hasn'tbeen a finer web series than this one since forever. My interest in watching Bollywood films and television shows has been piqued, despite the fact that I normally prefer American online series. I hope season two is just as good as the first. I almost let one slip, but there are no spoilers in this article. However, I won't give anything away about the movie because it's a masterpiece. You shouldn't expect a standard thriller with this show. Your thoughts are doing real w.\n",
      "Review 1869: The best web show with the combination of medical science and mythic stuff.Best performance by all. Arshad Warsiüëç\n",
      "Review 1870: Asur's talents as a performer are difficult to pin down. Just a glimpse, yet it had a wealth of meaning. Expert in forensics who decided to settle down with his wife, a Scary Asur, and have a family; he and his wife had their share of emotional ups and downs. This was a fantastic illustration of the suspense genre. The writing keeps you interested from beginning to end. Bickram Ghosh's score and performance of the score were beautiful. When the final scene played, the music gave me shivers. Asur was the last movie I saw a few days ago. Extensive research was put into mythology, astrology, science, and psychology, and the resulting links between them are nothing short of spectacular. The entire cast and team deserves congratulations. For me, it was completely enjoyable.\n",
      "Review 1871: Sacred Games (on Netflix) and Breathe (on Amazon) were the only Indian web series I had previously seen. But now I view things differently, thanks to Voot'sselection of ASUR as India's finest web series ever made. This is \"The Very Best,\" and you won't be able to remain in your seats. It's true to life, disgusting, and horrific. There are currently no large Voot select or Web series sales listed. But believe me when I say it is a wonderful gem and a magnificent example of Indian web series and television at its best. Never before have I provided such a good review to a film or web series. The improving quality of Indian cinema and television is quite encouraging. Fantastic performers have always been a part of our industry, but current directors are more concerned with plot. Our tales' quality is likewise improving. Finally, the word \"brilliant\" comes to mind.\n",
      "Review 1872: It's totally best thriller science fiction qnd it raises ur goosebumps..\n",
      "Review 1873: An amazing web series. Just loved it. Waiting for season 2..\n",
      "Review 1874: There is a mistake in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a character. The language in Asur alone kept me wondering until the very end, and the rest of the book is just as good. I binge-watched the entire season of Asur. I can't believe it. The sluggish pace occasionally becomes annoying, but it's worth it to learn about Indian mythology and story. Therefore, I didn'tmind it. I was relieved to see a Hindi thriller that held my interest throughout. Asur marks Arshad Warsi's triumphant comeback to the silver screen, thrilling his legion of devoted followers. The script and directing of this picture are top-notch. The timing of all the performances was impeccable. Everyone put out their best effort to ensure the success of the event. Gaurav Shukla should be commended for his excellent writing. Also, much appreciation to Abhijit, Niren Bhatt, and the rest of the stellar crew. My hands are twitching in anticipation of the next assignment.\n",
      "Review 1875: I love mythology and philosophy. I also love thriller, investigative and crime shows. This was a perfect combo with me. Just like Sacred Games where philosophy, idealism and real world played together, similarly in this show got to see these elements play out together. I totally enjoyed by the show, was continuously engaged and loved the entire experiencence. The show also gave me many ideas and experiences to ponder upon.\n",
      "Review 1876: This show is superb! The show will hold you till last.The show so far has lived up to my expectations with a well-assembled cast and the budget to explore.Looking forward to the rest of the season!\n",
      "Review 1877: Asur 2 is a terrific mythological thriller with unexpected events in each episode that will have you hooked till the finish. It's always the same villen who conspires against Dhanjay Rajpoot and his group. Arshad Warsi does the character justice with his/her creation. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are sharing their experience. The show's premise (AI for anticipating user behaviour) and utilisation of legendary aspects complement one other wonderfully. The rest of the cast did an excellent job as well, however several superfluous sequences dragged the tale out till episode 8. This programme would have been amazing if the episodes had been more neatly trimmed throughout the season. Anupriya Goenka's Hacking would cover a 30-minute episode, with her carrying out codes written by geeks for geeks (as a kind of fun).\n",
      "Review 1878: NO SPOILER.One of the best engaging Web Series of India but underrated also. Season 2 is a mixture of Science Hindu Mythology and Season 1 based on only Mythologyconcept. It represents the story in engaging form with suspense. Asur shows how can be the technology used in devastation of world in a wrong way (Darkweb). The use (AI))Artificial intelligence,( Deepfake) for making fake videos of anyone anyone and apps takes permissions from their users illegally by installing apps or giving permissions of phones. It shows the future predictions like the use of sonic boom bomb, etc.On this concept a anime series is also made Monster 2004.\n",
      "Review 1879: Everyone put out their best effort to ensure the success of the event. Gaurav Shukla should be commended for his excellent writing. Also, much appreciation to Abhijit, Niren Bhatt, and the rest of the stellar crew. My hands are twitching in anticipation of the next assignment. The idea is fantastic. After what seemed like an eternity, I was thrilled to see Arsad Warsi back on the big screen. It's incredible that a plan to fight evil in two parallel universes can actually succeed. The movie's description interested me even before I saw the trailer. The investigation of a serial killer by forensics professionals Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti in Asur is more than simply another crime thriller. It forces us to examine our fundamental assumptions and the choices we make under extreme stress.\n",
      "Review 1880: The lack of explicit language and obscene content is one of the series' defining characteristics. Spending time with loved ones may be rewarding. You should plan on spending at least seven to eight hours watching this series. Last but not least, both the acting and the camerawork are top-notch. There is not a single problem in the entire series. Asur is not only a popular show, but it is also deserving of its high ratings. I am suffering from an Asur hangover, yet I could not identify a single issue in this. Both the intro and outro songs are ominous. It has become ingrained in my mind. Truly, I can say that this concert is among the very finest I've ever seen. I just have to praise the script, the directing, and the performances. Recently, I spent a single day watching the whole length of Asur. I have never watched two Web shows in one day before. At last, a show that can hold its own intellectually against westerners. I appreciate the excellent standard of this series.\n",
      "Review 1881: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to individuals who appear cordial and reasonable but are actually pursuing their own agenda, wielding control over you, and prepared to corrupt your thoughts and ideas? A few life-or-death action situations generate unusual tension among the audience. The hero takes centre stage and conducts body searches in exotic locales, and the scenery is so breathtaking that it generates tension until the very end and is excellent overall. Outstandingly competent writing and performance! A must-see for fans of suspense! After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. INTRIGUING THINK-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING BEWITCHING.\n",
      "Review 1882: A masterwork of Bollywood filmmaking. I cannot wait for season two; this is Arshad Warsi at his finest. This is the best online series I've found in a very long time. This has whetted my appetite for Bollywood films and programmes, despite the fact that I typically watch American web series. I'm looking forwards to the second season and hoping it surpasses the first. This article contains no spoilers, although I almost let one escape. However, the film is a masterpiece, so I will not reveal it for anyone. This is not your average suspense series. Your intellect is actively engaged. The story develops well, and the middle section of the series leaves you desiring more. This article uses the term \"psychological thriller\" loosely, but it accurately characterises this programme.\n",
      "Review 1883: It is impossible to sum up the effectiveness of Asur in a few words. It only required a glance, yet the profundity of emotion it conveyed was extraordinary. He is a forensics expert by day and a devoted spouse and father by night to his Scary Asur wife. What a phenomenal page-turner! The script maintains the audience's interest throughout. The superb soundtrack, composed by Bickram Ghosh, was one of my favourite aspects of the film. The music in the closing credits gave me chills. I have just completed watching Asur. It is remarkable how the writers, directors, actors, and technicians collaborated to incorporate so many diverse disciplines of study into this masterpiece. I found it to be quite entertaining.\n",
      "Review 1884: Season 2 of Asur is exactly as exciting as the first. Outstanding performances are given by both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti. You'll be on the edge of your seat from the moment the narrative begins until the final page is turned. The programme is able to blend mythology with contemporary themes. The killer's use of the Vedas and other old traditions to rationalise murder is both interesting and frightening. It combines mythology with modern technology, delves into the potential perils of AI, provides a gripping narrative, and challenges viewers to think deeply about the ethical implications of such technology. The visual effects aren't always impressive, and there are a few gaps in the story.\n",
      "Review 1885: The sequence in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriyatorment another character was ruined by an editing error. Asur's writing is superb; it had me guessing till the very end. I've seen the complete series of Asur. It's fantastic, in my opinion. Slow in places, but useful for learning about Indian mythology and the core concepts of the story. As a result, I had no pain. After a long wait, I was fortunate to witness a gripping and suspenseful Hindi thriller. Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur, this time on a digital screen, for the sake of the audience and admirers. This film's writing and direction are both excellent. The performers' motions are well timed. Everyone gave it their all to make it a night to remember. Gaurav Shukla, I admire your amazing literary effort. Please also convey my best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the crew. I can't wait to get started on the next project.\n",
      "Review 1886: This web series clearly took a lot of time and effort to create. The narrative is interesting on several levels. The strong character depictions and the consistent quality of the storyline between episodes are evidence of the series' skill of storytelling. The series' depiction of the devastating impacts of contemporary warfare serves as a sombre reminder of the scope of those effects. More meticulously plotted web series like this are needed in the film industry. Therefore, I implore the show's creators to quickly develop Season 3. The script is top-notch, and Arshad Warsi's hypnotic turn as the protagonist elevates the show to new heights.\n",
      "Review 1887: Regarding effectiveness, Asur defies concise summarization. The quantity of emotion conveyed with a single gaze was astounding. He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely.\n",
      "Review 1888: After viewing the performance, can confidently assert that it is among the finest in the world. It should be shown not only to Indian audiences, but to the entire globe. Both the creator and the writers, both named Gaurav Shukla, did an excellent job. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The Thrilling and Thrilling series. Every waking moment, you fret about the future. The character of Psycho was introduced effectively. When I first saw this series, I was immediately captivated. It's wonderful, and the concept is both intriguing and perplexing, making for an intriguing web series. I've been telling all of my peers about this web series due to its high quality.\n",
      "Review 1889: This masterfully constructed web series effortlessly captivates its audience, drawing them into the story's intricate complexities. The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is demonstrated by the exceptional characterisation of multiple characters and the continuity between episodes. By exposing the destructive effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry must produce more web series with such high-quality screenplays. Therefore, I advise the creators to begin Season 3 production as soon as possible. The intriguing portrayal of the main character by Arshad Warsi adds to the.\n",
      "Review 1890: Are we more vulnerable to individuals who pretend to have our best interests at heart but are really after control over us and prepared to manipulate our thoughts and ideas to do their bidding in this high-tech, scientific environment where we are getting more alienated and lonely? Exotic tension is achieved by interspersing periods of tense terror with a handful of action sequences. This is the best in a series of action movies where the protagonist looks into mysterious deaths in faraway places with stunning scenery. Excellent plan, beautifully carried out. For fans of the genre, this is a must-watch. As someone who has watched every episode of this season, I feel prepared to offer commentary. OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY PHENOMENAL.\n",
      "Review 1891: Or the Artists (Composition, Directors, Actors). This is without a doubt worth your time. Hopeful anticipation for season two. Having watched the entire season, I can confidently describe this programme. I am confident in stating that the concert was one of the finest in the world after having witnessed it. The film should be viewed by people all over the world, not just in India. Both the creator and author, Gaurav Shukla, are to be commended for their excellent performance. Arshad Warsi, BarunSobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh gave outstanding performances in this work by Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal, which was deftly directed by Oni Sen. If you have the opportunity to attend the concert, it will remain in your memory eternally. Season 2 has my complete focus.\n",
      "Review 1892: Before viewing this online series, I believed that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix and Breathe season 1 on Amazon were the finest Indian web series. This is no longer the case, as Voot has crowned ASUR the greatest web series produced in India to date. This is \"The Very Best,\" and it is believable, evil, and disturbing. You will not be able to move from your positions. There are no significant promotions for Voot select or Web series. But believe me when I say it is a jewel,unadulterated gold, in the culture of Indian television and web series. Never before have I written such a positive review for a film or web series. It is encouraging to observe that the quality of Indian films and television is improving. Our industry has always had exceptional actors, but filmmakers are now also concerned with plot. The calibre of our content is also improving. In conclusion, only one word comes to mind: brilliant....\n",
      "Review 1893: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torture another individual. Asur's writing is superb on its own and kept me guessing until the very end. The entire first season of Asur was viewed in a single session. That is remarkable. The slower than usual tempo facilitates the reader's understanding of the central Indian mythology and culture. I had absolutely no complaints because of this. A relief was a Hindi suspense that held my attention until the very end. Those who admire Asur's previous films will appreciate Arshad Warsi's return. The plot and direction of this film are both outstanding. The entire ensemble has impeccable coordination. Everyone who contributed wanted it to be genuinely exceptional. We owe Gaurav Shukla gratitude for his insightful and well-written article. I would like to thank Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the outstanding personnel. My next assignment has yet to be determined.\n",
      "Review 1894: After viewing the performance, I can confidently assert that it is among the finest in the world. It should be shown not only to Indian audiences, but to the entire globe.

After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe this programme in a few words. INTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING SPELLBOUNDING After viewing the programme, I can confidently assert that it is of the highest calibre and world-class. It must be shown to audiences worldwide, not just in India. His team of writers, led by Gaurav Shukla, did an outstanding job. Thanks to Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt, Oni Sen's direction is outstanding. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh deliver outstanding performances. The performance will leave a lasting impression. I'm looking forwards to the second season.\n",
      "Review 1896: This show is notable for its lack of explicit language and sexual material. It's ideal for a family night in. The 7-8 hours you devote to this show will be well spent. Finally, both the acting and the cinematography are excellent. The entire series is flawless in every sense. Asur is not only a popular show, but it also deserves to be such. I'm suffering from a major Asur hangover, and I can't think of anything wrong with this. The opening and outro tracks are very scary. I can't stop thinking about it. It truly rates among the finest concerts I've ever seen. I was blown away by the story, direction, and performance. In one sitting, I saw Asur. I've never finished a Web series in a single sitting. Finally, a show capable of competing intellectually with the West. Thank you for making this amazing series available.\n",

You should watch the first season to better understand it and as per the season it keeps you on the edge of your sit and every episode will make you more excited for the next episode and you can watch it with your family and just can't wait for the 3 season and.\n",
      "Review 1898: Having personally experienced the performance, I can say without reservation that it is of the highest grade and quality. It can't merely be shown to Indians; it needs a global audience. Gaurav Shukla, the founder and author, has accomplished a remarkable feat. Both Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal contributed to its creation. The Series is packed with nail-biting tension. You spend each passing minute and second guessing what will happen next. The best possible way to get acquainted with Psycho. I was immediately drawn to this show after discovering it. The innovative and puzzling idea of the plot is what makes this web series so fascinating. I love recommending this online series to my friends and I also like viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 1899: Asur 2 is the zenith of mythical suspense, with each episode revealing more about the devious people of Villen who continue to deceive Dhanjay Rajpoot and his gang. Arshad Warsi had a fantastic performance as the well-developed protagonist. It's the same situation with Amey Wagh and Varun Arora. The basic tenet of the programme (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) pairs beautifully with the timeless story. Everyone else has contributed admirably, but the tale doesn't really get going until episode 8. This programme might not have made it through the first season if it had been edited properly. There will be a compilation of hacking scenes featuring Anupriya Goenka. The programme will last for only 30 minutes, and she will (ironically) carry out scripts written by geeks for geeks.\n",
      "Review 1900: This online series has been meticulously crafted, and it shows. There are multiple layers to the narrative, and each one is riveting. The series' expertise of storytelling is evident in the strong character depictions and the consistency of storyline excellence throughout episodes. By exposing the devastating results of modern warfare, the series serves as a sombre reminder of its far-reaching impacts. The film industry needs to produce more meticulously designed web series like this one. As a consequence, I encourage the show's creators to hurry up and finish Season 3. The writing is great, and Arshad Warsi's fascinating performance as the central character elevates the series.\n",
      "Review 1901: Or Writers, Directors, and Performers in the Arts. You should check it out. The second season will be anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I feel I can offer some useful vocabulary for discussing this programme. I can declare without reservation that the presentation is one of the best in the world and one of the most impressive things I have ever seen. Not just Indians but everyone everywhere should see it. The founder, Gaurav Shukla, and the authors, both named Gaurav Shukla, accomplished amazing work. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, SharibHashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh all gave exceptional performances. If you go attend the show, it will change your life forever. Season 2 has my anticipation.\n",
      "Review 1902: Regarding its performance, Asur cannot be summarised in a single term. The portrayal of profound emotions through a single, simple expression is effortless. Intelligent forensic expert to family man, a devoted father and spouse to a Fearsome Asur with whom he finds himself in an emotional struggle. This was a mind-boggling suspense novel. The screenplay maintains your interest throughout the film. Bickram Ghosh has done an excellent job with the background music, which I absolutely adored. The final scene with this BGM gave me chills. Just completed viewing Asur. It's incredible how well the research on mythology, astrology, science, and psychology has been integrated into the creation and execution of this masterpiece - kudos to the entire team, cast, and personnel! Enjoyed every word!\n",

      "Review 1904: Arshad Warsi, you are dead on. It has an excellent plot and is nicely handled. Everyone in the cast performed an outstanding job in their various parts. Asur, the best Hindi internet series, brilliantly blends science and Hindu philosophical topics. I thoroughly enjoyed it and eagerly await the next installment. Asur will receive every conceivable accolade this year. The greatest acting, directing, and narrative line all contribute to a web series that merits a perfect score of 10 out of 10. I can't believe I just completed this. I'll give it a go this weekend when all of the episodes are out, which is perfect considering that's when they filmed it. The shock is still fresh... Describe who or what Kali is. How long can this go on? Readers are kept guessing till the very conclusion of well-written works. Let's only hope the manufacturing and publishing procedures don't take too long.\n",
      "Review 1905: It was fun watching it. This is a thriller series and should be watched by thrill lover.Barun sobti did a great job in such a different role for him.This is a great story with realistic cinematography. Waiting for the second part.\n",
      "Review 1906: Asur is comparable to the name, but it has a negative connotation. A new #voot series has begun. The title of the series refers to how asur manifests within humans. What occurs when one priority is replaced by another? How your inner savage appears to aid you. Your hypothesis may be correct for one person but incorrect for another. A very well-written tale of despair. There are eight episodes, and each one draws you further and further into the story. Both the performances and the dialogue are bewildering. The team's dedication is exceptional. Must and cannot be neglected. Holy cow, there are only three syllables! What an incredible series! What an excellent start for Voot select! I have never witnessed anything similar on Indian television before. The story, direction, and performances were all excellent. It's a fantastic blend of crime.\n",
      "Review 1907: The lack of profanity and obscene language helps set this series different. The whole household may take part in the fun. Put aside seven to eight hours of your time, since you won't regret watching this series. Finally, the acting and cinematography are both very high quality. The entire series is flawless; there is not a single weak link. The high ratings that Asur has received are well deserved. There isn't a single weak spot here. My Asur hangover has set in. The music at the beginning and finish is quite eerie. It keeps playing in my brain. In all candour, it ranks among the very greatest concerts I've ever seen. Loved everything about it, including the script, the directing, and the performances. I finished Asur in one sitting. This is the first day I have ever binge-watched a whole Web series. At long last, a smart programme that can hold its own against westerns. Please accept my gratitude for providing us such a fantastic show.\n",
      "Review 1908: There is an editing mistake in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a character. Asur is excellent in every respect; the writing alone had me wondering right up to the very end. I watched every Asur episode in one sitting. This is fantastic. The pacing is a touch sluggish at times, but that only gives you more time to soak in the Indian mythology and plot. So, I was fine with it. Finally caught a hindi thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end. Arshad Warsi reunites with Asur on film, this time to the delight of his admirers. The script and directing of this film are both first-rate. The timing of all of the performers is impeccable. Everyone who had a hand in it did their best to make it special. We owe a debt of gratitude to Gaurav Shukla for his well crafted article. Thanks also to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the fantastic crew. Holding out for the next assignment.\n",
      "Review 1909: Its malicious meaning, asur, may be misunderstood. Fresh #voot content. The series' title alludes to the presence of asur within the human body. The ebb and flow of priorities. This is how your inner asur comes to the rescue. One individual could agree with you while another might disagree. This sad story was wonderfully written. There are a total of 8 episodes, and they all get progressively more involved with the story. Both the performance and the conversation leave you dumbfounded. The group's commitment is inspiring. Must not miss out on. What, in just those three words? What an incredible show! Wow, Voot choose is off to a great start! This is unlike any Indian television show I'veever seen. Everything about it was top-notch, from the script to the direction to the acting. It combines mythology with criminality to great effect.\n",
      "Review 1910: Everyone put forth their best effort to make it a night to remember. I appreciate your excellent work of literature, Gaurav Shukla. In addition, please extend my best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I'm eager to get started on the next task. This is a fantastic idea. After a long time, it was great to see ArsadWarsi in a film again. The concept of two planets uniting to defeat a common enemy is awesome. The bio was enough to convince me to watch it without first seeing a trailer. The story of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, two forensic experts on the hunt for the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur, is more than just a criminal thriller. The ideals, beliefs, and values we hold and the actions we do in the face of adversity are all called into question.\n",
      "Review 1911: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming more alone and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to people who look lovely and rational but in fact have their own purpose, to wield influence over you, ready to bend your thoughts and minds to their will.... A few high-stakes action sequences in the space between life and death produce an unsettling feeling in the audience. The action is a succession of scenes seen simultaneously, with the hero in the spotlight as he investigates grisly deaths in visually stunning and exotic locales. Excellent work; the writing is superb. A must-watch for all Thriller devotees! After watching the full season, I feel qualified to give a brief description of this programme. SPELLBINDINGLY MAGICALLY INTERESTING AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING.\n",
      "Review 1912: . After catching a few episodes, I can say with confidence that the show is exceptional. It has to be seen by people all across the world, not only in India. The work done by Gaurav Shukla and his team of writers is superb. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. This series is packed with nail-biting tension. You spend every passing second and minute fretting about the future. This serves as a great introduction to the psychotic character. My curiosity in the series was peaked right from the start. It'sso mind-blowing, and the story's idea is so thrilling and mysterious, that I can't help but be intrigued by the web series. This is a fantastic web series that I like watching and have recommended to many of my friends.\n",
      "Review 1913: Asur's abilities as a performer defy succinct characteriszation. A quick glance, yet such depth of feeling conveyed. Intelligent forensics expert turned family man, married to a Scary Asur with whom he struggles emotionally; caring father and husband. What a superb example of the suspense genre this was. The script maintains your attention throughout the movie. The music in the background, which was composed and performed by Bickram Ghosh, was stunning. I got chills during the final scene with that background music. A few days ago, I finished watching Asur. Mythology, astrology, science, and psychology were all meticulously researched, and their intricate interconnections in the making of this masterwork are nothing short of brilliant. Congratulations to the whole cast and crew! Every second of it was fun for me.\n",
      "Review 1914: In my opinion, among the finest Bollywood movies ever made. Incredible acting, but I'm partial to Dr. BarunSobti in particular. This is the best web series I've seen in a long time, and it's made me eager to check out Bollywood content. I hope the second season lives up to the first, and I thank the cast and crew for their hard work. Please watch it because it is a masterpiece; this has no spoilers, but I am tempted to tell you one. This novel transcends the genre of thriller. It deceives your brain. At the midpoint of the series, the narrative builds beautifully and leaves you wanting more. A \"psychological thriller\" in the truest meaning of the phrase describes this show.\n",
      "Review 1915: Asur's second season is just as compelling as the first. Both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti have outstanding performances. The story unfolds rapidly, leaving you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The show successfully marries mythology and modernity. It's both fascinating and horrifying that the killer uses the Vedas and other ancient traditions to justify his or her actions. It blends mythology with technology; it explores the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it may be used for evil; it has excellent acting; it has a well-paced story; it has thrilling tension; and it will make you think. There are several holes in the tale and the visual effects aren'talways great.\n",
      "Review 1916: The performances, plotting, visuals, soundtrack, and story all contribute to make this an outstanding show. All of the actors and actresses did a fantastic job, especially Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra. This show is a surefire winner. It'sthe sort of show that sticks with you, making you question what's right and whether or not our own standards of rightness are accurate. This show has come a long way in bridging the gap between myth and the modern world. I highly recommend it...you should totally check it out, and season 3 has me very excited. This mind-blowing suspense thriller will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The preview does not do justice to the film. An excellent plot and screenplay with elements of mythology, psychology, forensics, and amazing music. Do not miss this chance.\n",
      "Review 1917: To say nothing of the singers, filmmakers, and performers. The show is well worth your time. Season 2 has my anticipation. After watching the full season, I feel qualified to give a brief description of this programme. After witnessing the programme, I can say with some assurance that it is first-rate and world-class. It is intriguing, thought-provoking, incredible, mind-blowing, and spellbinding. It has to be seen by people all across the world, not only in India. The work done by Gaurav Shukla and his team of writers is superb. The directing by Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen is superb. Excellent acting is provided by Arshad Warsi, BarunSobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh. The show has a profound impact on viewers. The upcoming season 2 has my anticipation.\n",
      "Review 1918: Someone made a mistake in editing the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torment another character. The plot of Asur is well-written; I had no idea how it would conclude. I have seen the entirety of Asur. That just blows my mind. The tale moves slowly at times, but it's worth it to learn about Indian mythology and the plot's fundamental concepts. Consequently, I felt no discomfort. After what felt like an age, I was able to watch a thrilling Hindi thriller. Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur, but this time he does it digitally on a screen for the enjoyment of the audience. The screenplay and direction are both excellent. The dancers are perfectly in rhythm with each other. Everybody did their absolute best to make the event a huge success. What you've written is excellent; please keep it up, Gaurav Shukla. I also hope that Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team have as much success as they deserve. I can't wait to get into the next project.\n",
      "Review 1919: . The performances, production values, design, set, costumes, music, and plot are all superb. There were several outstanding performances, including those by Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riddhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra. This performance can't possibly bomb. It's the kind of show that makes you question the validity of your own sense of right and wrong. The project has come a long way in terms of successfully blending the magical with the contemporary. I'm so excited for the third season that I can hardly contain my enthusiasm for it. This terrific suspense thriller will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The actual film is far superior to the trailer. Fantastic music and a compelling story that successfully combines mythology, psychology, forensics, and more. Do not waste this chance.\n",
      "Review 1920: Among the finest Bollywood films ever made. Dr. Barun Sobti stands out for his exceptional contributions. This series has piqued my interest in Bollywood films and television for the first time. I admire the cast and crew for their hard work, and I eagerly await the second season. While there are no surprises here, I do have to give something away. This novel isn't only a suspenseful thriller. A mental ruse to deceive you. The plot begins to pick up speed about the midway point, and it ends with you wanting more. This programme perfectly exemplifies the genre of \"psychological thriller\" in every sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 1921: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torture another individual. Asur's writing is superb on its own and kept me guessing until the very end. The entire first season of Asur was viewed in a single session. That is remarkable. The slower than usual tempo facilitates the reader's understanding of the central Indian mythology and culture. I had absolutely no complaints because of this. A relief was a Hindi suspense that held my attention until the very end. Those who admire Asur's previous films will appreciate Arshad Warsi's return. The plot and direction of this film are both outstanding. The entire ensemble has impeccable coordination. Everyone who.\n",
      "Review 1922: A work of art in Bollywood movie. Amazing performance, particularly from BARUN SOBTI; this is Arshad Warsi at his best; I can't wait for season two. This is the best web series I've seen in a long time. Despite the fact that I normally watch American web series, this has stoked my interest for Bollywood films and programmes. I'm looking forwards to season two and hoping it lives up to the first. There are no spoilers in this article, though I almost did. But, because the film is a masterpiece, I won't ruin it for anyone. This isn't your average thriller series. Your intellect is very much involved. The plot moves along smoothly, and the series' middle portion leaves you wanting more. Although the term \"psychological thriller\" is used loosely, it appropriately defines this programme.\n",
      "Review 1923: The narrative, acting, narration, visuals, and sound design all work together to make this a fantastic presentation. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, AnupriyaGoenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, MeiyangChang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra have all given outstanding performances. This programme is deserving of the award, and it will receive it. It's the type of show that makes you question whether your assumptions about good and wrong are valid. This series has gone to great lengths to mix futuristic and mythical aspects. Strongly advised...check it out, and look forwards to season three with bated breath. This incredible suspense thriller will have you wondering until the very end. The trailer does not do the film justice. It has it all: mythology, psychology, forensics, a terrific score, and a well-planned storyline. Strongly recommended.\n",
      "Review 1924: Everyone in attendance did their utmost to make it a night to remember. Thank you very much to Gaurav Shukla, who wrote this beautifully. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team should be commended as well. The following job is currently pending. The concept is quite creative, and it was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi back on TV after such a lengthy absence. The concept of two universes opposing evil is intriguing. Even before I watched the trailer, the summary sold me on the film. In their pursuit of the serial killer known only as \"Asur,\" forensic scientists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a cat-and-mouse game. At various stages, our ideals, beliefs, and values, as well as the decisions we make in seemingly hopeless situations, are all brought into question.\n",
      "Review 1925: In today's high-tech, scientific world, where we're becoming more alienated and lonely, how vulnerable are we to folks who, on the surface, appear friendly and sensible but, in fact, have their own agenda, power over you, and are ready to influence your thoughts and minds? There are a few suspenseful action scenes involving life and death that contribute to the film's exotic feel. The action develops in a series of linked sequences, with the hero at the centre, and takes place in foreign locations where the hero must conduct body searches. Excellent in both form and function! A must-see for suspense fans! After viewing the entire season, I believe I am qualified to contribute some descriptive terminology about this show. MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC STUNNING BREATHTAKING.\n",
      "Review 1926: Mr. Warsi, you have hit the nail on the head. The story is excellent, and the film is expertly directed. Everyone in their respective roles did a fantastic job. I have just finished Asur, the greatest Hindi web series to combine a scientific and Hindu worldview. I can't wait for the next chapter. That's a huge deal, dude. Asur will sweep the board this year. The acting, direction, and story in this web series are all top-notch, earning it a perfect score of 10 from us. What the heck have I done... Since they finally released all of the episodes over the weekend, I've opted to watch it then. I haven't gotten over it yet... Just who is Kali, anyway? When will this madness finally stop? The author's intelligence will keep you guessing about what will happen next. All I can do is hope that the time spent by authors and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 1927: Asur defies categorisation as a performer. Just a glance, yet it conveys so much. Despite the mental anguish brought on by his marriage to a Scary Asur, he is faithful to his wife and children and has become an expert in the field of forensics. The narrative here is very suspenseful. The screenplay is superb, and it manages to hold your interest throughout the entire film. Bickram Ghosh wrote and played the incredible music. The final scene and tune gave me the shivers. A few days ago, I completed the film Asur. The incredible connections between mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology that were uncovered during the construction of this masterwork are reflected in the depth and breadth of the study that went into its creation. I'd want to offer my best wishes to everyone involved in the production. I enjoyed every single second of it immensely.\n",
      "Review 1928: Asur 2 is a fantastic mythical tale that will hold your attention throughout every episode. This is just more of the same evil person who is always fooling DhanjayRajpoot and his group. Arshad Warsi, the author, does a fantastic job portraying the character. The circumstances of Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are very similar. The narrative of the programme is a wonderful fit for the show's idea (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and its blend of legendary mythology. Although the rest of the actors did a great job, the tale was dragged out till episode 8 by some superfluous sequences. If the episodes had been more tightly edited, this show may have been great for six seasons. A thirty minute episode of Hacking, in which Anupriya Gonekaruns (for fun) scripts written by programmers for geeks, may be pieced together from several sequences featuring Goneka.\n",
      "Review 1929: It's a great show all the way around, from the acting and writing to the structure and aesthetics to the music and, yeah, the narrative. Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, along with Arshad Warsi and BarunSobti, have all done outstanding work. This programme will undoubtedly take home the prise. It's the sort of programme that makes you question your own assumptions about the world. This show has gone far beyond the superficial by fusing mythology and technology. I can't speak highly enough of it; please give it a look. An incredible mystery that will keep you wondering right up to the conclusion. The teaser does not do credit to the whole film. The film has a great music, a well-thought-out tale, and touches on mythology, psychology, forensics, and more. There's a chance you shouldn't let slip by.\n",
      "Review 1930: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDINGINTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The concert will forever remain in your memory. I eagerly anticipate.\n",
      "Review 1931: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything in Asur is excellent, but the writing kept me puzzled and captivated until the very end. I have watched each episode of Asur. It is very impressive. It occasionally proceeds slowly, but this helps the reader comprehend the plot and Indian mythology. So I had no objections. After a lengthy absence, I watched an Urdu suspense that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears alongside Asur on a digital projection for the audience and his followers. The script and execution of this film are outstanding.\n",
      "Review 1932: Asur 2 is an episode-by-episode mythological thriller with incredible developments. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team are routinely duped by a recurring gang of swindle artists. Arshad Warsi has done the character justice, who is so ingeniously crafted. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh share a similar situation. The premise of the show is perfectly adapted to the underlying principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the combination of legendary tales. Other members of the Starcast have also performed admirably, but certain passages are so lengthy as to be superfluous and extend the narrative until episode eight. If the editing had been precise, six episodes would have been sufficient for this programme. Hacking Sequences is a 30-minute brief episode in which Anupriya Gokhale implements algorithms created by nerds for geeks.\n",
      "Review 1933: This series is distinguished by its lack of immorality and foul language. It is appropriate for family entertainment. This course will not disappoint if you devote 7-8 hours to it. Moreover, the performances and cinematography are also exceptional. There is not a single flaw in the series. Asur is not only a popular series, but it also merits its popularity. This contains no flaws; everything is ideal. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. Beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It has become ingrained in my mind. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot resist praising the screenplay, direction, and acting. I watched Asur in a single day. I have never before completed a Web series in a single day. Finally, a programme with Western.\n",
      "Review 1934: Arshad Warsi, you nailed it. It has a brilliant plot and is expertly executed. All of the characters played their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy. Outstanding effort, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! This year, every award will go to Asur. In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end? Clever writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the amount of time taken by.\n",
      "Review 1935: This masterfully constructed web series effortlessly captivates its audience, drawing them into the story's intricate complexities. The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is demonstrated by the exceptional characterisation of multiple characters and the continuity between episodes. By exposing the destructive effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry must produce more web series with such high-quality screenplays. Therefore, I advise the creators to begin Season 3 production as soon as possible. The intriguing portrayal of the main character by Arshad Warsi adds to the series' perplexing nature, and the writing is.\n",
      "Review 1936: Regarding effectiveness, Asur defies concise summarization. The quantity of emotion conveyed with a single gaze was astounding. He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely appreciated it.\n",
      "Review 1937: Or the Artists (Musicians, Directors of Film, Performers). Spending some time on this is strongly advised. Season two is anxiously anticipated. After viewing the entire season of this programme, I feel confident writing about it. After attending the concert, I can state categorically that it was among the finest performances I have ever witnessed anywhere in the world. The film must be disseminated internationally, not just in India. Inventor and author Gaurav Shukla deserves praise for their outstanding endeavour. If you have the. This is the very best movie and very helpful movie and good movie.\n",
      "Review 1938: This show is unlike any other since it avoids profanity and swearing while focusing solely on the story. You and your loved ones might have a good time. Setting aside seven to eight hours to watch this series will not be time wasted. Finally, both the acting and the camerawork are top-notch. You won't find a single mistake in this entire series. Asur is a popular show because it is excellent. I'm suffering from an Asur hangover, but I couldn't find a single thing wrong with this. Both the opening and closing scores include ominous music. It's been drilled into my head. Truly, I can say that this concert is among the best I've ever attended. I can't say enough good things about the script, the direction, and the acting. In a single day, I watched the entirety of Asur. My viewing of two Web series in one day is a first for me. At last, a programme that can compete intellectually with western entertainment. I appreciate you putting on such a high-quality series.\n",
      "Review 1939: Asur 2 is a fantastic mythological thriller with surprising developments in every episode that will have you watching till the very end. It's the same villen who always connives against Dhanjay Rajpoot and his crew. The character is brilliantly created, and Arshad Warsi does him/her credit. It's a shared experience for Varun Arora and Amey Wagh. The show's premise (AI for predicting user behaviour) and utilisation of mythological elements work beautifully together. The rest of the actors performed a wonderful job as well, however the story was dragged out until episode 8 by some unnecessary sequences. If the episodes had been more tightly edited, this show would have been fantastic throughout the full season. The entirety of Anupriya Goenka's Hacking would fill a 30-minute episode, and she would be seen carrying out codes created by geeks for geeks (as a kind of entertainment).\n",
      "Review 1940: I can confidently assert that the performance is of the highest quality and grade because I witnessed it. It must be exhibited all over the globe, not just in India. The founder and author, Gaurav Shukla, has accomplished a great deal. The authors of this work are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. This series has unparalleled suspense. You continually ponder what will occur in the next minute. A outstanding framework for comprehending the Psycho character. When I first discovered this series, I knew I would enjoy it. The web series is even more captivating due to the plot's mind-boggling premise. I enjoy recommending this online series to my peers because it's so excellent.\n",
      "Review 1941: Among the loveliest Bollywood films ever produced, in my opinion. I am particularly impressed by Dr. BarunSobti's performance. This is the finest web series I'veseen in a long time, and it has piqued my interest in Bollywood films. I hope the second season surpasses the first, and I appreciate the cast and crew's efforts. Please view it because it is a work of art; there are no spoilers here, but I'm compelled to reveal one. This novel transcends the suspense genre. It deceives your intellect. At the series' midpoint, the narrative develops gorgeously and leaves you wanting more. This programme is a \"psychological thriller\" in the strictest sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 1942: The story, performances, narrative, visuals, and soundtrack all contribute to the excellence of this production. In particular, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Riddhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra did an outstanding job. This programme is an assured hit. It is the type of programme that makes you query what is right and whether our own standards of rightness are accurate. This programme has made significant progress in bridging the divide between mythology and the modern world. I wholeheartedly recommend it...you should definitely try it out, and I'm very excited for season three. The entirety of this mind-blowing suspense novel will keep you on the edge of your seat. The preview does not do the film credit. An outstanding narrative and screenplay with mythology, psychology, forensics, and incredible music. Do not overlook this opportunity.\n",
      "Review 1943: The second season of Asur is just as captivating as the first. The performances of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobtiare both exceptional. The story's rapid progression will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The show effectively combines mythology and contemporary elements. The killer's use of the Vedas and other ancient traditions to justify his or her actions is both enthralling and appalling. It combines mythology and technology; it examines the perils of artificial intelligence and how it can be used for evil; it has excellent acting, a well-paced plot, exhilarating tension, and it will provoke thought. There are numerous plot gaps and the visual effects are not always impressive.\n",
      "Review 1944: And, in this high-tech, scientific world in which we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to people who appear charming and logical but have their own agenda, namely to exert influence over you and alter your thoughts and minds to their will? A few high-stakes action sequences that occur in the space between life and death unnerve the audience. The action consists of a series of simultaneous sequences in which the protagonist investigates grisly deaths in visually spectacular and exotic locales. Outstanding achievement; the writing is excellent. A must-see for all fans of Thriller! After viewing the entire season, I feel qualified to provide a summary of this programme. MAGICALLY BEWITCHINGLY INTERESTING AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING.\n",
      "Review 1945: Only the first seasons of Sacred Games (on Netflix) and Breathe (on Amazon) constituted my prior exposure to Indian web series. As a result of Voot's selection of ASUR as India's greatest web series of all time, my perspective has shifted significantly. You will be unable to remain seated during \"The Very Best\" because of its realism, vileness, and horror. There are currently no significant Voot select or Web series sales advertised. But believe me when I say that it is a genuine treasure and a shining illustration of the finest in Indian web series and television. Never before have I given such a glowing review to a film or web series. The rising quality of Indian film and television is very encouraging. Incredible actors have always been a part of our profession, but contemporary filmmakers are becoming increasingly interested in plot. The quality of our narratives is also improving. Eventually, the term \"brilliant\" comes to mind.\n",
      "Review 1946: After watching a few episodes, I can confidently state that the programme is outstanding. It must be viewed by individuals everywhere, not just in India. The work done by Gaurav Shukla and his writing team is excellent. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. This series is crammed with tense moments. You spend each and every second and minute worrying about the future. This is an exceptional introduction to the psychotic character. My interest in the series was piqued from the beginning. The web series is so mind-boggling and the story's premise is so intriguing and enigmatic that I cannot help but be intrigued. I enjoy viewing this excellent web series and have recommended it to many of my peers.\n",
      "Review 1947: As a performer, Asur's abilities defy succinct description. A quick gaze, yet conveying such emotional profundity. Intelligent forensics specialist turned family man, married to a terrifying Asur with whom he struggles emotionally; loving father and spouse. This was an excellent example of the suspense genre. The script maintains your interest throughout the duration of the film. The backdrop music, composed and performed by Bickram Ghosh, was breathtaking. The background music during the final sequence gave me shivers. A few days ago, I concluded my viewing of Asur. Mythology, astrology, science, and psychology were exhaustively researched, and their intricate interconnections in the creation of this masterpiece are nothing short of brilliant. Best wishes to the entire ensemble and crew! I thoroughly enjoyed every second.\n",
      "Review 1948: Asur's malevolent connotation may be misconstrued. New #voot material. The title of the series references the presence of asur within the human organism. The fluctuating nature of priorities. This is how your inner scoundrel comes to your aid. Someone could concur with you, while someone else could disagree. This tragic tale was beautifully written. There are a total of eight episodes, and each one becomes increasingly entwined in the plot. The performance and conversation render you speechless. The group's dedication is invigorating. Not to be missed out on. What, in merely three words? What an amazing performance! Wow, Voot choose is off to a fantastic beginning! This television programme is unlike any Indian programme I've ever seen. The script, the direction, and the performances were all of the highest calibre. It effectively integrates mythology and criminality.\n",
      "Review 1949: So intrigue so engrossing each frame so so well crafted that keeps you on the edge of the screen. Each character so well balanced with shades of black and white... the bgm is brilliant... all the 8 episode has the storyline so well narrated .... Arshad warsi at its best and anusha goenka have been the best with the subh guy so well he has carried the role... you cannot stop unless u finish the entire season in 1 go . It will not let you go and for then hours it will stay lingering in your mind. Director Oni Sens sir solid respects for such brilliance ... you have blessed the viewers with such awe content... now thats whatvwe call a brilliant storytelling.... thank you so much.\n",
      "Review 1950: The plot, acting, images, music, and especially the sound make this a mind-blowing series. Everyone from Arshad Warsi to Abhishek Chauhan to Rishad Dogra to Meiyang Chang to Amey Wagh to Pawan Chopra has had a career-best performance. This show will win the prise without a doubt. This is the kind of show that makes us question our own morals and the validity of our own assumptions. This show has made a concerted attempt to blend science fiction and fantasy elements. Strongly suggested...check it out, and be prepared to excitedly await the third season. You won't be able to stop thinking about this mind-blowing suspense tale. It looks better than the teaser suggests. It has everything: mythology, psychology, forensics, beautiful score, and a great story. It should not be disregarded.\n",
      "Review 1951: . Or the actors, the choreographer, and the composer. This is something you should see. I can't wait for season two! After viewing the whole season, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language about this programme. I can say without reservation that the performance is of the highest grade and quality since I witnessed it myself. It can't merely be shown to Indians; it needs a global audience. Gaurav Shukla, the founder and author, has accomplished a remarkable feat. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriya Goenka, SharibHashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh did an excellent job supervising the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. Your memories of the performance will last a lifetime. As for me, I can't wait for season two.\n",
      "Review 1952: As an entertainer, Asur defies categorisation. A transient glance, yet conveying such emotional profundity. Intelligent forensics specialist turned family man; devoted father and spouse; married to an emotionally distressing Scary Asur. This is an excellent example of the suspense genre. The writing maintains your interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh produced and performed the magnificent background music. The final scene and accompanying music gave me chills. A few days ago, I completed viewing the movie Asur. Mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology were all exhaustively investigated, and the intricate connections between them in the creation of this masterpiece are nothing short of brilliant. Congratulations to all cast and crew members! I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.\n",
      "Review 1953: As the title of a new #voot series, the term asur, which means \"evil,\" refers to the origin of asur within the human body. The manner in which one priority replaces another. The manner in which your inner fury saves your life. Your viewpoint may be correct for some individuals but not for others. An exceptionally well-written tale of melancholy. Each of the eight episodes completely immerses the audience in the storyline. As with the performances, the conversation with the director is mute. The sum of the team's efforts is astounding. Both must and must not be ignored. Three words: oh my God! What a collection! What a beginning for Vote Select! I've never seen anything like this on Indian television before. The script, direction, and acting are all outstanding. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",

      "Review 1956: Or the directors, actors, and actresses. Definitely worth a look. Season 2 has peaked my attention. After watching the entire season, I'd want to sum up this show in a few words. After witnessing the programme, I can certainly claim that it is of the greatest standard and world-class. It should be shown to audiences all throughout the world, not only in India. His writing team, lead by Gaurav Shukla, performed an excellent job. Oni Sen's directing is excellent, thanks to Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. Outstanding performances are given by Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh. The performance will leave an indelible mark. I'm excited for the second season.\n",

      "Review 1964: Direction and screenplay are nice. The series has some standout scenes in bits and pieces. If you are in mood of a decent one time watch but bingeable thriller, you can give it a shot. Better than the decent usual run of the mill predictive thriller series out there.\n",
      "Review 1965: Direction and screenplay are nice. The movie has some standout scenes in bits and pieces. If you are in mood of a decent one time watch thriller, you can give it a shot. Better than the decent usual run of the mill predictive thriller movies.\n",

      "Review 1973: Asur is One of the best series of 2020 for sure :)\n",
      "Review 1974: 'Asur welcome to your dark side' series tells us the uncommon truths of this world. How a man can be worse by circumstances. And the acting of arsad varasi and his co-actor is outstanding. The fiction takes us in a crisis which can also happen in our fortune. You must see this once in your life. I assure you'll enjoy this.\n",
      "Review 1975: First time I Binge watched a web series. It was a suspenseful experience to travel along with the story of ASUR. The performances from all the actors was awesome. The concept of the web series left me awestruck. It is such brilliantly showcased on the screen so that till the end of the web series you feel like clinging to end of your seat to unveil the suspense. Its basically a concept showing the mix of Mythology and practicality and their fight is amazing. You will actually see a cat-mouse chase in the whole web series. I watched this web series without watching the trailer. So who is chasing whom?? If you watch , then you will find it out. I wont give any spoilers. I won't ruin your suspense.\n",
      "Review 1976: This screenplay is not comparable to real life investigations. First time I watch this type of screenplay where almost every thing is based on intuitions. The story lineup, concept and dialogs are good but it can be done very marvelously which they have failed to do.\n",
      "Review 1977: It is very very awesome and i would definitely recommend it to all people who watch CRIME THRILLER series . Sacred Games is just over hyped because people don't even know what content to actually love and hype and what to not. This series has no 18+ content unlike Sacred Games which in both the seasons was mostly famous for the 18+ content. Both the seasons of Sacred Games combined cannot beat ASUR.\n",
      "Review 1978: Asur is definitely the best Indian Crime Thriller Series and one of the best in the world. The story setup episode wise is just perfect and direction is on a different level altogether. The actors have also done a great job especially the character of Nikhil Nair.This is the second show after Sacred Games where concepts of Hindu mythology have been linked with contemporary scenes.\n",
      "Review 1979: From 1 to 8 episodes is awesome but ending sucks..\n",

      "Review 1983: Just simply awesome storyline. It is a puzzle. As per last period of previous decade we came ro know that villain got more better perspective of life and world than heroes.Here it is, just like thanos and joker, Shubh shown the real world to us. Envy, anger.... etc... Villain is so strong that he got every nerve of CBI. Must watch\n",

      "Review 1987: This is one of the Great Web Series by Voot, truly unbelievable and different from all other OTT platforms. Just let down on the last episode which is highly disappointed. Rest all things too well. Arshad Warsi's acting was great as always. Secred Games kaa Baap hai Baap.\n",
      "Review 1988: Wow!!! Great story, great direction and great acting. Awesome execution. 10/10 for sure.\n",
      "Review 1989: Asur is the perfect online serial for technical person like me. it adds some real life forensics, technology with the help of some decent performances of its main protagonists. The seed of the criminal mind is sown in the Holy city of Varanasi and the antagonist goes out to form a 'cult' of his own. The show also portrays high quality forensics at work. It is very entertaining as well as knowledge enhancing show go for it.\n",
      "Review 1990: Storyline is just great. You will love it. And the main character is also great. You can't stop watching again and again\n",

      "Review 1997: Other then the entertainment part of this web series, this one is more for the Intellectual (also can say mature) people. This movie will arise so many questions in your mind. And that is what movie wants to convey.\n",
      "Review 1998: Poor acting, worst direction and third class cinematography. Was excited to watch but got disappointed after watching. Lots plot holes and illogical scenes. Like who the hell shot the murder scene tape with lots of different angles and editing. Worst series\n",
      "Review 1999: The trailer is amazing. Super catchy. Very interesting and gripping. Will definitely watch this. Always a fan of Arshad's work.

A must watch.\n",

      "Review 2001: A very unique show which has a amazing blend of hindu mythology and forensic science. Directors like these should direct bollywood films and give chances to deserving actors(not strugglers). There is twist and turns in each and every episode. The way that each episode is interlinked with the next , it's just beyond explanation. A must try tv series. Such type of series is rare , i repeat very rare. So do not miss it and do watch\n",
      "Review 2002: #Asur is one of the best psycho thriller with brilliant acting and great script. This low budget web series is better than Sacred Games and Mirzapur. Believe me you will forget #Corona\n",
      "Review 2003: Well, Asur is a decent show, but not extraordinary. There are many plots missing in this show, but still it excels just because of it's brilliant piece of writting and a very well researched approach on indian mythology. This web series tries to give you a decent plot and better understanding of Indian mythology with current scenarios. The story runs on two parallels. One is with mythology and the other one is social justice. It revolves around between a crime thriller and a horror approach.Hopefully the second season would be more powerful and logical. It's not a must watch, rather it's a one time watch.\n",
      "Review 2004: This is one of the most amazing series available in the Hindi series world. The message is very bold and clear. The entire story will blow you out.Amazing things about the series:-Crystal clear and to the point story.Very bold and very important message.Amazing use of mythology.Good acting.Waiting for series like this..\n",

      "Review 2009: This is by far the best gothic Indian thriller series out there. To fuse Indian mythology and serial killer stuff, with a Harvey dent-batman-joker like approach ..is all stuff of brilliance. Highly recommended. Idiots who run it down don't know jack. Watch it...a must watch.\n",
      "Review 2010: I can say its one of the best webseries i have watched . This webseries is full of thriller and suspence and the writing part has done very smartly. I liked the performance of the actors and they roles. Quite interesting series.\n",
      "Review 2011: This series of season 1 and 2 combined is a pure and smooth cinema. No intimacy, vulgarity yet so engaging.... I just wanna say its a rare masterpiece, Plz do watch and decide üëåüèªThe way Arshad and Varun nailed their respective characters is just incredible. The perfect blend of crime with spirituality gives a unique experience to the audience. I think asur season 1 was slightly more interesting but its due to as we weren't ready for this classic series and we watched season 1 which lead to our minds to be blown. If season 1 is 10, then season 2 is 9.9 , no such difference but all I can say is let's appreciate this national masterpiece, Our Indian Web Series Suspense Thriller üôèüèªüëåüèª\n",

      "Review 2017: I think the makers are scared of revealing all the things of series .like they did in last.episode they should give a clear story about what happened , who was real murder or any clue.they make us think. There are some downs. Otherwise all good.\n",

You'll be higest disappointed.The story is predictable, but still there's loopholes. I started watching this after a friend strongly recommended it but after finishing it I was wtf..Cbi had never been so dull, hacking been never so easy, but you'd see all of these here and can't stop cringing.Only arsad warsi saved the show.The way CBI acted, I couldn't stop laughing. They were helpless and demonstrated as dumb officials.Very poor story writing. Don't know why it got lots of 10 star reviews.\n",

      "Review 2033: With what intensity Arshad Warsi has portrayed that character. Nailed it totally. Such a right choice for this type of character. In some scenes the intense look keeps us more hooked to the series not letting us to even take a washroom break. Wonderfully written and wonderfully directed. AWESOME\n",
      "Review 2034: It was a great piece of work by both the directors and script writers.....the screenplay was also quite original and unique in its on way. It keep you interested in throughout the storyline and the consequences of the actions taken. Many times you can connect to inner demons that we struggle with on many days of our regular life. It has greatly depicted the one side of the story on the drastic measures that lead the whole storyline.\n",
      "Review 2035: It is a great piece of work by both the directors and the script writers plus the cast because they pulled it off very well. The choice of cast is appropriate. Even the screenplay seemed original and unique. There's a handful of actions between fear of life and death which sets an exciting pitch among viewers.\n",
      "Review 2036: I can't even describe in words the beauty of this series. One of the best till date. Keeps you hooked and guessing all the time. It is more of a psychology than a thriller. Great screenplay, great background music and great story. The top 3 ingredients required to make a great series or movie and Asur has it all. Well done!\n",
      "Review 2037: Super show.... Just finishing up season 1 and can't wait to watch the season 2....\n",

      "Review 2039: The concept of this series is Outstanding Once you watch this series , I am Sure You will again want to watch this. It has a different concept and It is the Fabulous series I have ever watched. Usually I don't watch this kind of series. But I am in love with this one.\n",
      "Review 2040: Asur is not just any random thriller with a basic story line but an outstanding amalgation of thrill crime and mythology. The way the story unfolds itself, hooks you to the screen completely. With every passing moment spent trying to anticipate what happens next. Kudos to the actors for portraying the characters so well.\n",
      "Review 2041: Asur does complete justice to the suspence and thrill that the viewers expect. You are completely hooked to your screen,trying to anticipate things. The characters have been very well portrayed. Mr. Arshad warsi has done a great job. I would recommend all to atleast watch it once.\n",
      "Review 2042: First the trailer is perfect to catch the attention of web series lover, and then the pilot episode maintained a great suspense that forced me to binge watch the series.

      "Review 2043: The trailer itself is outstanding.Saw the trailer randomly and pressed the play option and at the last of those few minute trailer \"worth it\" is all that came out of my mouth. Arshad sir had a great performance solving the murder mysteries,and i dont remember the last time i saw him in such a serious role. A MUST WATCH SERIES\n",
      "Review 2044: Asur is more a psychology than a thriller and a detective. How are decisions made, how do decisions affect our loved ones and the world around us? Why do we value our loved ones less than we depend on them? What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.\n",
      "Review 2045: Without any spoilers... I had a great time watching this nerve recking series. Arshad wasid is really a versatile actor and his role was very well done.

      "Review 2207: Series can be relate with dark knight,as in the aspects such as self vs world, overpowered villain,very layered story etc.mustcwatch\n",
      "Review 2208: Before watching this web series I had an opinion that Sacred Games season 1 on Netflix, and Breathe season 1 on Amazon are best web series made in India . But now my opinion is TOTALLY CHANGED, It's Voot select ASUR which is the best web series made till date in India. This is \"The Best \".. I always recommend my friends to watch this absolutely incredible web series and I also myself love watching it too.. Background music is given perfectly. Totally love watching. Recommending to all.. Hope more people watch it :)\n",
      "Review 2209: There are plenty of such twists in the tale, but nothing goes as big as the benchmark set by the first twist. But they are enough to keep you riveted with where the plot is going.. The cast of asur, which includes actors like Arshad Warsi, barun Sobti and anupriya goenka have performed well. The creator Gaurav Shukla and the writing team of Asur have done some really good work.The acting, story, character, role play everything is on point but I don't want to ruin it for you so go and watch.\n",
      "Review 2210: The story revolves around a psychopath killer who thinks he's an Asur. The storyline is good and this series will give you a real chill. But overall it's JUST GOOD, not excellent. The first episode itself at some point becomes really slow. You'll also encounter some points where you'll have to fast forward it. I don't know why so many people here are giving it 10 and straightforwardly worshipping this show, which makes them look as voot is promoting the show through imdb.\n",
      "Review 2211: This series is really a great step for horror and thrill.Wooooww.. what a suspense thriller series, has become one of my favorite. Arshad has done such an amazing role. I just binge watched the entire season in one go as I couldn't control the thrill and suspense in it. Its a must watch for those who are crazy for horror and thriller genre. All the artists/actors have executed their roles perfectly. Asur deserves to be awarded for the best web series of the year. Kudos to team Asur, keep up the good work:)\n",
      "Review 2212: It's a very interesting series.From the first scene itself it makes me to think about what's coming next. Logics are really working in the crime investigation. As the name clearly signifies that this series is about the Dark Side of humans.This series is beyond Netflix and Amazon prime. It is not only a psycho crime thriller series but also a thought provoking about humans.Hats off to the creator Gurav Shukla.He did an amazing work on the script.That's much interesting it is. Watching the whole series in a single day will make you mad about the human race\n",
      "Review 2213: I was just recommended by one of my friend to watch this series he was legit forcing me to watch this cause he liked it so much so I had to start watching it and after watching episode 1 I felt like I should watch next episode cause the twist was so good and I continuously watched around 5 episodes and remaining 3 after some time. The psychology adapted by the director to show the events and the consequences is worth the praise!\n",
      "Review 2214: With what intensity Arshad Warsi has portrayed that character. Nailed it totally. In some scenes the intense look keeps us more hooked to the series not letting us to even take a washroom break. Wonderfully written and wonderfully directed.

      "Review 2215: I really loved the way how the things have been portrayed in ASUR. The performance and acting by the characters was great. I personally enjoyed it. I bet you will watch all episodes in one go. Oni sen has perfectly directed this series asur hats off to him. Brilliantly performed by arshad, barun, ridhi, anupriya, sharib, hashmi, gaurav and amey. I really can't wait for second season. But this series is not kids friendly or family show due to extreme violence. what a suspense thriller series, has become one of my favorite.

      "Review 2217: Dialogues and performances are just awesome and make the show way better. Connecting the two worlds- Logical reasoning and Myth is the most impressive part.What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.. Can't stop raving about the writing, direction and acting.\n",
      "Review 2218: The psychology adapted by the director to show the events and the consequences is worth the praise. The makers have successfully managed to create a haunting atmosphere, aided by a sombre background score, that is ready to suck you in from the first episode itself. The creator Gaurav Shukla and the writing team of Asur have done some really good work. The BGM was really good. Asur is a must watch for those who love thrillers!!!!!\n",
      "Review 2219: The way the story has been executed and the story itself is engaging which will lead you to a binge watch..the complex mix of hindu mythology and science has made it more obvious to get one of a rare kind of genre and the way that the facts have been put upon is so strong which indeed depicts a deep study of the subject .....the cliffhanger in the end ..,the depiction of evil within good and how they are directly proportional in order to maintain the equilibrium of life is Mind blowing ..... Clearly one of the best crime thrillers of india which itself justifies its 9.4 on the scale üòä\n",

      "Review 2222: This web series provided a complete package what an Indian crowd is looking for rationally. A baseline of Mythology with supporting psychological factors and events and on top of it Forensic science incorporated so beautifully that the show will keep you stick to the seat. Hats off to the Director for the clean execution and not messing up like Sacred Games-2. Arshad Warsi after a long time has got such a good indepth layered character to play. Sharib Hashmi made us laugh and cry. Amey Wagh was a complete Surprise (not breakingbout for spoilers). Ridhi Dongra was exceptionally magnificent and did a decent work in this show. Barun was a character that will take you through the series, he will make you feel you are living the scenes and takes us through a roller coaster ride of emotions, love, passion and sense of mind. The antagonist mainly the child character was scary, the confidence in his words,fire in his eyes and that evil smile is breathtaking.\n",

The Actors have done a great Job bringing this story to life, writing was outstanding and Direction was greatly executed. One particular Actor totally sold the whole series for me, Barun Sobti, he played his character Nikhil Nair so perfectly. If it wasn't for Barun the show would have been good but he made it great.\n",

      "Review 2249: Lower your expectations! and you might enjoy it a bit.Asur is the blend of Hindu Mythology and science that captures the human psychology trapped between Good and Evil between Dark and Light.. Asur is the juxtaposition of religion and science and what a belief can force a human to pursue and how easily set of beliefs can hinge someones mind.There are total 8 episodes in season 1 each episodes comprises 35 to 45 minutes.\n",
      "Review 2250: Asur is a decent effort by Voot in the already convoluted online content market. I would give this show and its 8 Episodes a 10 out of 10 purely for its original idea and a great production design as well as to story. This is a decent more than one-time watch web series.\n",
      "Review 2251: One of its kind of webseries. Very unique content, very sound story, excellent acting by all and Above all direction is super logically fit with script.

Therefore I rated it 10/10\n",
      "Review 2252: Asur is a perfect combination of strong direction, acting as wellas script. A child is born in a day before due to some accident dueto this everyone started calling it ASUR.

      "Review 2253: We all are aware Asur present in modern time too but in different way they are modernize now. This story perfectly represent the modern Human Asur. Asur takes place in present day India where an unknown serial killer is putting the CBI and Delhi Police in tenterhooks. The killer sends GPS coordinates of each murder to the Police and keeps them guessing about his next crime. Each murder is targeted at an individual who himself/herself is a do-gooder and successful.\n",
      "Review 2254: Wow What a web series Asur . The real- life locations in Varanasi are giving amazing feel. The Delhi locations, jails etc also look real. The music is also very good and the opening theme stays with you. Similarly, the real looking laboratories of forensics at CBI looks original with genuine shots and scientific references. The dead bodies also look real. In shot it look like we are not watching show we are watching something live. Hats off\n",
      "Review 2255: Asur is all about 3 people Dhananjay a CBI officer, 2nd Nikhil,and 3rd one is subh joshi. The story and episode each are connectedwith other and force you to not left the tv before completing the fullweb series. Eagerly waiting for season 2\n",
      "Review 2256: All episodes of the Asur are highly engaging you can't leave any episode in between and after finished watching the first you are eager to watch the 2nd one and so on Each episode reveals something new about the killer. In one episode, he is able to fool an entire team of policemen in a graveyard and abducts Nikhil right under their nose. It looks a bit exaggerated but is passable. Every thing in this show is up to the mark must watch\n",

      "Review 2265: Had never seen a web series like this in India before..surely it will be a milestone of Indian web series if it reaches to people More..But I think The Director should Leave it Here Because If Second season Comes..More Stronger Writing will be needed..And They Have to work Much More Harder..But of course as an audience I will definitely wait to watch the season 2 With Much More Expectations...But I had told previously because Of The previous records of Indian web series sequels,especially of The *Narcos Of India* 'Sacred Games'\n",

      "Review 2380: The characters are played so beautifully! Hats off to all the actors. The theme's good portrayal is very convincing. Waiting for more episodes to know the ending.\n",
      "Review 2381: So all in all it's a great watch, spend your extended lockdown days watching Asur you won't be disappointed,I can guarantee you that .\n",
      "Review 2382: Series goes so slow like snail. Looks like tried to stretch very short story to longer length. BGM is the worst - don't really match the emotion/s and instead like random mapping of several junks to several scenes. This series doesn't qualify to be a thriller in terms of it's speed. Many scenes and even some dialogues match to an american TV series BLINDSPOT. Lot of the the signature of this series does match to that as BLINDSPOT.Over all it doesn't deserve to get even a single star but the given 2 are for trying to connect the possible thrill to typical myth/s in India.For few, it might be worth watching. But, for those who are used to fast phase stories (usually what thrillers do unlike family drama and love stories), this could become very boring - like HELL.\n",
      "Review 2383: This is the crime, mystery, thriller web series.A unique crime thriller that pits two opposing worlds against each other. The less explored, intricate world of forensic science and the deep mysticism of ancient Indian Mythology.\n",
      "Review 2384: It's a decent show and deserves 9 or 10. Like everyone else i was looking forward to it because it's a Voot Select family series it have the charm like other Voot shows do\n",
      "Review 2385: Awesome and Unique blend of thrill with drama, spirituality and criminal psychology. I watched this series it's nice but varun sobti just Mind-blowing in this series. I dont have words how to explain how Awesome he is in the series\n",

      "Review 2388: It is amazing how this series is addictive inspite of it being so gritty & all the characters being so immoral & ruthless that to empathise with anyone of them is difficult . Pace is well handled . The Zeigarnik effect is well used with each episode\n",
      "Review 2389: Captivating, excellent dialogues and great acting. If you miss to watch this Asur Series you definitely miss the awesomeness.\n",
      "Review 2390: This series was a welcome surprise. The story and dialogues are refreshingly original and really insert you into the tension of the story. The amazing acting by relatively unknown actors is surprising\n",
      "Review 2391: Asur shows what the best of what Indian shows have to offer. The story feels real and captivates you from the start. It shows some rudiwadi thought of a typical Indian family which forces the child to become asur. Then again this is how I imagine it is in India and the series doesn't shy away showing the dark side of it all. Watching this with subtitles will take a lot away from it so i'd say its a must watch for anyone who knows Hindi\n",
      "Review 2392: As i belong to the same district i couldn't stop myself in finishing this in a day, the movie depicts almost a true story, the story could have been better instead of revolving around a bunch of people, on a nutshell the series is a must watch thriller from voot\n",
      "Review 2393: The budget and the star cast used in this series is incomparable with any high budget series. I loved it and the show will add one extra mile at Voot Select! Kudos to the creator. We are proud that the director proved he is the finest director of the Industry . The dialogue and the location used is the best. Loved each episode.\n",
      "Review 2394: I really don't understand why some of the reviews given above are negative , I found this series so indulging and intense and gripping that I completed it in one go without break. The amazing part is around the character which is amazing , the whole cast works superb, no loose point i found here , it's not fully digestible but a perfect series. Kudos to Asur team and Voot Select\n",

      "Review 2396: It is a very well directed show with extreme attention to detail. It has been shot in real settings and in every frame the work behind the scenes shows.\n",
      "Review 2397: This is a really great show and I would like to see more of this in the next season. Do take the time to enjoy it. It gives the social message as well of what happens when the raw energy of youth doesn't get channeled into the right medium-anarchy, chaos and corruption rules.\n",
      "Review 2398: The story has so many different angles. Amazing performances by all actors\n",

      "Review 2410: The best part of the show was that it seemed realistic. You can basically connect to their accent which is exactly the same and has been precisely depicted in the show. It could have been great if the screenplay and character build up was a bit better\n",
      "Review 2411: After a very long time I saw a good web series. Just speechless.. hats off to the director and all the actors. Must watch web series for each and every Indian cinema lover\n",
      "Review 2412: After watching Asur it is hard to guess you are watching a less budget cinema. Yo Small budget cinema is improving now. One of the best TV series on voot select right now is undoubtedly Asur. Craving for the second season started as soon as the last episode ended\n",
      "Review 2413: Completely hooked. Better watching this in Indian with subtitles than the English dub. Great story, great actors and the way they finished the season, just when it starts getting more interesting makes me mad because I've got to wait how long until the next season\n",
      "Review 2414: Asur brings revolution in Indian cinema I never ever expect that such a loud and realisitic murder scenes can be shoot in India too. Hats off\n",
      "Review 2415: With a solid start to the drama,every episode makes your heart beat faster. The rawness of the drama is surreal and gets you hooked. Every episode leaves you with a question unanswered? and doesn't answer them till the very last. Great acting by the whole cast.Not only do the \"star\" actors shine but an amazing supporting cast keeps you engaged.\n",
      "Review 2416: After reading many reviews about Asur I gave a chance to this web series after watching a few episodes believe me I feel it has everything you would have been craving for. Most importantly it is not based on any mithogocial subject it is a story of a super intelligent criminal boy overall Mind blowing Arshad Warsi nailed the character...Superb acting.... Absolutely worthy of your time..\n",

      "Review 2418: I just loved it, it's awesome to watch such a nice series from India. All actors are perfectly good in their roles, Barun, Arshad and others are too good. Everything seems so real and you just forget it's acting. Great in every way!!!\n",

      "Review 2427: Since i'm thriller movie lover. I am a fan of korean and spanish thrillers. Right, i can't expect those from bollywood but i didn't find that much thrill in Asur. BGM and casting felt OK to me. But character build up wasn't so good.\n",

      "Review 2432: Creating this web series required a substantial amount of time and effort. The story is intriguing on multiple levels. The series' talent as a storyteller is evidenced by the vivid depictions of the characters and the continuity of the plot throughout the episodes. The series' depiction of the devastating effects of modern warfare serves as a sobering reminder of their scope. In the film industry, there is a need for more web series with meticulous plotting. Therefore, I implore the show's creators to develop Season 3 as soon as possible. The script is excellent, and Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance as the protagonist propels the show to new heights.\n",
      "Review 2433: Everyone there gave their all to make it a memorable evening. The author, Gaurav Shukla, has done an excellent work with this. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the personnel should also be commended for their endeavours. The next task is pending completion. It was great to see arsad warsi return on television after such a lengthy absence, as the concept is extremely sophisticated. The concept of two universes battling evil is intriguing. Before I even saw the trailer, the synopsis of the film convinced me to watch it. In pursuit of the serial killer known only as \"Asur,\" Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a game of cat-and-mouse. At various points, our principles, beliefs, and values, as well as the decisions we make in seemingly hopeless circumstances, are all called into question.\n",
      "Review 2434: #Asur Is Personally a completely satisfying indian series.\n",
      "Review 2435: He established himself day by day through to his work and proved himself He is such a gem and we know that Love you\n",

After watching this series, it left me speechless towards the end & it shows you the reality of humanity that many a times even if you choose good over evil, evil may also win. Eagerly awaiting for the second season.\n",
      "Review 2454: After viewing the programme, I can confidently assert that it is outstanding and ranks among the best in the world. The film should be viewed by people all over the world, not just in India. Both the creator and author, Gaurav Shukla, are to be commended for their excellent performance. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. A collection of incredibly thrilling adventures. You cannot help but conjecture about the future every moment that you are awake. Psycho, the protagonist, was portrayed convincingly. I knew I had to read this series as soon as I saw it. Amazing work, with an intriguing and perplexing enough premise to create a wonderful web series. I have recommended this online series to anyone who would listen.\n",
      "Review 2455: Everyone who contributed to its creation intended to make it exceptional. Thank you to Gaurav Shukla for his insightful and well-written post. Thank you to NirenBhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the incredible team. I am awaiting my next assignment. The concept is lovely. After what seemed like an eternity, I was relieved to see Arsad Warsi in another film. It is remarkable that a plan to combat evil involving two parallel universes can succeed. I was already intrigued in watching this film prior to viewing the trailer. Asur is not merely another crime drama in which forensics specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti pursue a serial murderer. Extreme tension compels us to query our guiding principles and the significance of our decisions.\n",
      "Review 2456: The storyline is no dought awesome. These kind of stories really fascinates the audience who would love the thoughts showcased in it.\n",
      "Review 2457: There is an editing error in the scene in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torture another character. Asur is exceptional in every respect; the writing alone kept me puzzled until the very end. I viewed the entire first season of Asur in one sitting. Wow, that is incredible. A slower-than-average cadence allows for a deeper immersion in the mythology and culture of India. That is why I had no objections. I was relieved to watch a hindisuspense that held my interest until the very end. Fans of Arshad Warsi will be delighted to see him reunite on-screen with Asur. This film has an exceptional script and direction. Everyone on stage possesses impeccable synchronisation. Everyone who contributed to its creation intended to make it exceptional. Thank you to Gaurav Shukla for his insightful and well-written post. Thank you to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the incredible team. I am awaiting my next assignment.\n",
      "Review 2458: Asur may be confused with the name, but it means wicked.. a new #voot series. The title of the series refers to how asur appears within man or human. How priorities shift from one to the other. How your inner asur appears to save you. Your notion may be correct for one person but incorrect for another. A very well-written gloomy narrative. 8 episodes, each of which takes you further and deeper into the plot. The acting and dialogue are both speechless. The team's dedication is admirable. Must and must not be missed. Oh my gosh, only three words!! What an amazing series!! What a promising start for Voot select! I've never seen an Indian television programme like this before. The storyline, directing, and performances were all excellent. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 2459: Asur web series proves that Good content doesn't need any faltu promotions & bina mtlb ka bollywood masala! Sirf talent ki jarurat haiüî•üëè\n",

      "Review 2461: Please don't remove barun even from this series loved arshad and all performances. Great stories, awesome artist. I am waiting for it.\n",
      "Review 2462: There is a line in the series, where Arshad, while in prison, suggests something that could put him in trouble / get him arrested!!To which he replies, 'already andhar hoon. Aur kitna andhar daalenge!' I imagined Circuit from Munna Bhai saying it, and laughed out loud!And for that, this series gets 5 points!Avoidable!! Def better series out there to waste 6 odd hours of our lives, lockdown or no lockdown!!!!\n",
      "Review 2463: Asur web series is full of suspense and they maintain there suspense till the end of web series. Suspense makes this series best. This web series was alson thriller and person cannot just watch it without using their brain. Hope the second season continues with the same flow.\n",
      "Review 2464: May be the web-series is thrilling and has a good story. However, such stories which end up showing extra-judicial ways of giving justice as the only way to the solution. Therefore such stories must be BANNED from display. Such content ends up only encouraging and making people believe that resort to extra-judicial modes of getting the SO CALLED JUSTICE is the only way out.In fact, I would have been more happy if instead of how the story actually ended, DJ would have been shown to apologise for what he had done to the juvenile accused. That would have given a vital and important message to the society.\n",
      "Review 2465: Each episode of Asur 2 reveals more about the cunning villen ancestors who continue to con Dhanjayrajpoot and his crew, making it the pinnacle of mythological suspense. Excellent performance by Arshad Warsi as the well-written character. Varun Arora and Amey wagh are in the same situation. Artificial intelligence for predicting user behaviour and behaviour is a natural match with the program's well-known plot. The remainder of Starcast has also been successful, although the story meanders unnecessarily until episode eight. If the episodes had been appropriately edited, the programme might have lasted longer than the first season. A Compilation of Anupriya Goenka's Hacking Scenes The session will only last 30 minutes, and she will (ironically) execute programmes specifically designed for computer geeks.\n",
      "Review 2466: Don't watch useless Bollywood movies. You should watch this web series. Although it has some abusive words but still you will enjoy it.\n",
      "Review 2467: Arshad Warsi, you nailed it. It has a brilliant plot and is expertly executed. All of the characters played their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy. Outstanding effort, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! This year, every award will go to Asur. In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end? Clever writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the amount of time taken by creators and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 2468: There isn't any webseries or any movie better than this. I can bet with the whole world. This is just the 8th wonder of the world being narrated as a web series. The casting, the plot,the cinematography,the direction,the acting,the technicalities, the difference in views of mythology & science is just spellbound. From the entry to the climax there was not a single loophole. The acting of the child as kalki is more than mesmerizing. IMDb should rate it 15stars or anything more than that. Such type of web series are eye-opener to the ruthless society. Love from Debayan Bhattacharya to all the people associated with the webseries even the fans.\n",
      "Review 2469: It's immense suspence and uncertainty filled ending leaves me giving 9..that the conclusion could have been shaped better deducting 1.. Overall a wonderful one.\n",
      "Review 2470: Mind blowing, Gut wrenching, Awesome... all these words fall short for India's best web series ever and the World shall watch. It's not for the faint-hearted and a must watch for the lovers of psychological thriller genre.\n",
      "Review 2471: After witnessing the performance, I can declare without reservation that it is first-rate and among the best I've ever seen. Not just Indian viewers, but everyone should see it. Both the creator and the authors have the same name, and both did an excellent job. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt are the writers. Exciting episodes from a thrilling series. You can't stop thinking about the future, even when you're sleeping. The first glimpse of Psycho worked well. I was instantly hooked on this show after my first viewing. It's exceptional, and the idea is intriguing and mysterious, making for a fascinating web series. This online series is so good that I have been recommending it to everyone I know.\n",
      "Review 2472: Asur is comparable to the name, but it has a negative connotation. A new #voot series has begun. The title of the series refers to how asur manifests within humans. What occurs when one priority is replaced by another? How your inner savage appears to aid you. Your hypothesis may be correct for one person but incorrect for another. A very well-written tale of despair. There are eight episodes, and each one draws you further and further into the story. Both the performances and the dialogue are bewildering. The team's dedication is exceptional. Must and cannot be neglected. Holy cow, there are only three syllables! What an incredible series! What an excellent start for Voot select! I have never witnessed anything similar on Indian television before. The story, direction, and performances were all excellent. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 2473: This series is distinguished by its lack of immorality and foul language. It is appropriate for family entertainment. This course will not disappoint if you devote 7-8 hours to it. Moreover, theperformances and cinematography are also exceptional. There is not a single flaw in the series. Asur is not only a popular series, but it also merits its popularity. This contains no flaws; everything is ideal. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. Beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It has become ingrained in my mind. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot resist praising the screenplay, direction, and.\n",
      "Review 2474: Everyone involved did their utmost to make the event memorable. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to the next endeavour. The concept is brilliant. It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi on film again after a lengthy absence. Wonderful is the concept of two planets confronting an evil aspect. I viewed it without viewing the trailer due to the bio. Asur is more than just a criminal thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti pursue a serial murderer, Asur. It compels us to reevaluate our principles, beliefs, and values at various points in our lives, as well as the decisions we make when confronted with extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 2475: And, in this high-tech, scientific world, where we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we falling prey to individuals who appear charming and logical but have their own agenda, seeking to exert influence over you and mould your thoughts and beliefs to their will? A few adrenaline-fueled set pieces between the foreboding of life and death leave the audience with an odd feeling. The action consists of a series of sequences viewed concurrently, with the protagonist taking centre stage and searching for corpses in exotic locales, and the scenery is breathtaking. It is generally excellent and maintains suspense to the conclusion. Excellent composition and execution! Fans of suspense should not miss this!\n",
      "Review 2476: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDINGINTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The concert will forever remain in your memory. I eagerly anticipate the second season. 10. It is a mind-blowing series.\n",
      "Review 2477: This is one of the best Bollywood films I've ever seen. Arshad Warsi's performance in BARUN SOBTI is the best I've ever seen, and I eagerly anticipate the second season. I haven't seen a better online series in quite some time. I enjoy watching Hollywood web series, but this has piqued my curiosity about Bollywood content. I hope the second season surpasses the first. This article contains no spoilers, but I am compelled to reveal one. However, I will not because the film is an artistic creation. This series is more than just a suspense. It stimulates mental activity. The story advances effectively, and the conclusion leaves you wanting more! This programme is a \"psychological thriller\" in the finest sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 2478: One of the best Bollywood films ever made, in my view. I've been waiting for a web series like SOBTI BARUN, and it hasn't disappointed; season one had excellent acting from one of my favourite actors, Arshad Warsi, so I'm looking forwards to season two. I'm eager to check out more Bollywood productions now. My curiosity in Bollywood has been sparked; I usually watch American television, but I feel compelled to recommend this film to you because of its artistic merit and refrain from giving away any spoilers. There's a lot more here than just a good story. This is a good way to get your brain working. The narrative begins to develop and your interest level rises towards the show's midpoint. A \"psychological thriller\" is a fair descriptor for this programme.\n",
      "Review 2479: It's obvious that a lot of work went into making this web series. The story is intriguing on a number of fronts. The expertise of the show's storytellers is on display in the vivid portrayals of the characters and the continuity of the plot from episode to episode. The series is a sobering reminder of the breadth of the ramifications of modern conflict through its depiction of its deadly consequences. The film business could use more web series with such a carefully crafted narrative. As a result, I beg the show's producers to hurry up and make Season 3. Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance as the protagonist complements a storyline that is already excellent.\n",
      "Review 2480: Asur is similar to the name, however it signifies evil. A new #voot series has begun. The series' title relates to how asur manifests itself within man or human. What happens when priorities move from one to the other. How your inner asur appears to come to your aid. Your hypothesis might be right for one individual but erroneous for another. A very well-written bleak story. There are eight episodes, each of which pulls you deeper and deeper into the narrative. Both the acting and the discourse are dumbfounded. The team's commitment is outstanding. Must and must not be overlooked. Oh my goodness, only three words! What a fantastic series!! What a good beginning for Voot select! I've never seen something like this on Indian television before. The plot, direction, and acting were all superb. It's an excellent combination of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 2481: The show's greatness stems from its superb ensemble acting, writing, structure, graphics, music, and plot. All of them have been fantastic, including Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra. This programme will undeniably take home the gold. Seeing a presentation like this might challenge your preconceived notions. This series has gone to great lengths to blend mythology with science. I can't stress how much you should read it enough. Incredible suspense that doesn't let up until the last page. The teaser does not do credit to the whole film. Everything from mythology to psychology to forensics to great music to a tightly plotted drama is there in this picture. Don't let this chance slip through your fingers.\n",
      "Review 2482: There is a mistake in the editing of the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing another person. The writing in Asur is excellent on its own and kept me wondering right up to the very end. All of Asur's first season was seen in one sitting. That's incredible. The slower than usual pace helps the reader get a better feel for the Indian mythology and culture that are central to the plot. That's why I had absolutely no complaints. A hindi thriller that had me interest till the very end was a welcome relief. Those who like Asur's previous films would enjoy seeing Arshad Warsi in it again. This film's plot and direction are both top-notch. The timing of the entire cast is impeccable. Everyone who contributed to it aspired for it to be truly remarkable. We owe a debt of gratitude to Gaurav Shukla for his insightful and well-written piece. I'd want to express my gratitude to NirenBhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the fantastic crew. My next assignment is still pending.\n",
      "Review 2483: Arshad Warsi, you are absolutely correct. The concept is excellent, and it is executed smoothly. Everyone did an outstanding job of getting into character. Asur, the greatest of the Hindi online series, does a fantastic job of bridging Hindu spiritual themes with scientific ones. I couldn't put it down, and I can't wait for the next installment. Asur will receive any and all accolades bestowed this year. I give a flawless score of 10 out of 10 for the best web series ever in terms of acting, direction, and plot. I can't believe I just done that. I'll give it a shot over the weekend, when all the episodes are out (they taped on the weekend, which is convenient for me). Still processing the shock of the unexpected... Help me understand who Kali is. How pervasive is this problem, exactly? The finest works of literature keep their audiences guessing until the very last page. Let's hope it doesn't take too long to go through the production and publication processes.\n",
      "Review 2484: Asur 2 is the height of legendary tension, with new information revealed in each episode about the clever genuinues of villen who keep fooling Dhanjay rajpootand his gang. Arshad Warsi gave a fantastic performance as the well-developed character. Varun Arora and Amey wagh are in the same situation. The use of AI to analyse and forecast user activity is a seamless addition to the show's well-known plot. Starcast as a whole has been successful, however the plot drags on needlessly until the eighth episode. The programme may have lasted longer than its first season if the episodes had been trimmed better. Compilation of Anupriya Goenka's Hacking Scenes She will (ironically) run applications made for computer nerds throughout the brief 30-minute session.\n",
      "Review 2485: Asur is just not a web series, it is a mirror of our derk side. I don't ever watch like this web series. This web series is so far better than today's some stupid bollywood movies.What a web series, best content, better acting, best story, best direction etc...This is a very unique story.I'm very thankful to team Asur to gift us like this type of web series.And I strongly waiting for session 2.\n",
      "Review 2486: After seeing the performance, I can undoubtedly assert that it is of the highest quality and calibre. It must be shown to audiences worldwide, not just in India. His team of writers, led by Gaurav Shukla, did an outstanding job. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. This series is packed with tension. Every minute and second, you're unsure of what will happen next. A fantastic introduction to Psycho's character. This series immediately piqued my interest. The story's premise is both intriguing and puzzling, making the web series even more captivating. I frequently recommend this excellent web series to my peers, and I also enjoy viewing it.\n",
      "Review 2487: The performance of Asur cannot be described in a single term. Simple single-gaze, yet extremely profound emotions conveyed with simplicity. Intelligent forensic specialist to a family man, a devoted father and spouse to a Fearsome Asur with whom he struggles emotionally. This was an excellent suspense novel. Throughout the duration of the film, the script maintains your intrigue. Bickram Ghosh did a wonderful job with the background music, which I found to be quite beautiful. I felt shivers during the final instant of the background music. I havejust completed watching Asur. The research on mythology, astrology, science, and psychology, as well as how well it has all been integrated to create and executethis masterpiece, is phenomenal; congratulations to the entire team, cast, and personnel! I enjoyed every minute of.\n",

After viewing the entire season, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language about this programme. STUNNING BREATHTAKING MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC After viewing the show, I can declare with some certainty that it is outstanding and among the best in the world. It shouldn't just be screened for Indian audiences, but for the entire world. Excellent job, both by Gaurav Shukla the inventor and by Gaurav Shukla the authors. A Work by Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal competently headed by Oni Sen The outstanding performances of Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh. If you catch the show, it will leave an indelible mark on your memory. I'm eagerly anticipating Season 2.\n",
      "Review 2489: Is it conceivable that in today's high-tech, scientific world, when individuals are becoming increasingly alienated and lonely, you would be more susceptible to being manipulated by those who, on the surface, appear rational and nice? The audience is spooked by a few instances of high-stakes action that are on the verge of being fatal. The protagonist is followed through a series of linked episodes as he investigates gruesome deaths in aesthetically stunning and exotic locations. Superb outcomes; equally superb writing. A must-see for any fan of the genre! Now that I've seen the entire season, I can give a fair summary of this TV show. Spellbindingly captivating and thought-provoking.\n",
      "Review 2490: A masterpiece among Bollywood cinema. Incredible acting, especially from BARUN SOBTI; this is Arshad Warsi at his finest; I can't wait for season two. I haven't found a better online series in a long time than this one. Even though I usually watch American web series, this has whetted my appetite for Bollywood movies and shows. I'm anticipating season two and praying it lives up to the first. There are no spoilers in this piece, although I almost let one slip. The film is a masterpiece, though, so I won't spoil it for anyone. This is not your typical thriller series. Your mind is actively involved. The story progresses nicely, and the series' middle section leaves you wanting more. The word \"psychological thriller\" is used loosely here, yet it accurately describes this show.\n",
      "Review 2491: You are absolutely correct, Mr. Warsi. The concept is brilliant, and its execution is flawless. Everyone did an excellent job assuming their respective roles. Asur, the best Hindi web series, does an excellent job of bridging Hindu spiritual themes with scientific ones. I was unable to set it down, and I eagerly anticipate the next installment. This year, Asur will obtain every accolade bestowed. In terms of acting, direction, and plot, I assign the greatest web series ever a perfect score of 10 out of 10. I cannot believe that just occurred. This weekend, when all the episodes are available (they were recorded on the weekend, which is opportune for me), I'll give it a try. Still processing the unexpected shock... Please explain who Kali is to me. How widespread is this issue, precisely? The best literary works keep their readers guessing until the very last page. Let's hope that the production and publication procedures do not take too.\n",
      "Review 2492: Every each episode of Asur 2 reveals more about the cunning genuinues of villen who keep tricking Dhanjay rajpoot and his gang, making it the pinnacle of mythical suspense. Arshad Warsi's performance as the well-written character was excellent. Amey wagh and Varun Arora are in the same boat. Artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction is a natural fit with the program's renowned narrative. The rest of Starcast has done well as well, although the story drags on needlessly until episode 8. If the episodes had been edited properly, the show may have lasted longer than its first season.

A handful of life-and-death-related action sequences generate exotic suspense among viewers. Action is a series of seen it together with the hero taking centre stage and conducting body searches in exotic locales, and the settings are so incredible that it generates suspense until the end and is overall amazing.

      "Review 2494: It's also important to give credit to the performers, directors, and authors. It would be unfortunate to be unable to attend this show. Season 2 really caught my curiosity. Now that I've seen the entire season, I can give a fair summary of this TV show. After viewing the series, I can declare without a doubt that it is of the highest conceivable quality. It is fascinating, thought-provoking, astounding, and mind-boggling. It should be seen by people all throughout the world, not only in India. The writing by Gaurav Shukla and his colleagues is excellent. The leadership of Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt Oni Sen is superb. A fantastic performance is delivered by every single cast member, including Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh. The event will have a profound effect on a lot of individuals. I'm dying for Season 2 to begin.\n",
      "Review 2495: Alternatively, the actors, the director, and the soundtrack. It's definitely worth seeing. Season 2 cannot come soon enough! After viewing the entire season, I believe I am qualified to contribute some descriptive terminology about this show. After seeing the performance, I can say with assurance that it is of the highest grade and level. It should be exhibited all throughout the world, not only in India, since it is spellbinding, intriguing, thought-provoking, and mind-blowing. Gaurav Shukla, the company's creator and author, has done a lot. Under the capable leadership of Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh, as well as Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal, produced remarkable work. If you witness the show, it will make an unforgettable impression on you. The second season of the programme has my undivided attention.\n",
      "Review 2496: Asur Season 2 is a well-produced and suspenseful drama. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti provide standout performances. The plot goes rapidly, and the reader is kept guessing until the finish. The series perfectly blends mythology and science fiction. The killer's aims are revealed via references to the Vedas and other ancient literature, which is both intriguing and unsettling. The perils of AI are also examined, as is the possibility for evil AI to bring about...Here are some of the series' advantages and cons: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced storyline *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are lacklustre.\n",
      "Review 2497: The absence of explicit sexual content and language distinguishes this series from others. If desired, include everyone in the household. Seven or eight hours is suggested for viewing the entire series. Moreover, the cinematography and performances are excellent. The entire series is outstanding from start to finish. Asur's high favorability ratings are merited. There is no singular vulnerable point. My Asur hangover has reached its peak. The opening and concluding music are extremely ominous. My thoughts continually return to that instant. Without antinn ann of the launliant the very best movie.\n",
      "Review 2498: Asur 2 is the pinnacle of tension, with each episode revealing new details about the cunning villen descendants who continue to con Dhanjay rajpoot and his crew. Arshad Warsi's portrayal of the well-developed character was outstanding. Varun Arora and Amey wagh are in identical circumstances. The use of artificial intelligence to analyse and predict user activity is a seamless addition to the show's established narrative. Starcast as a whole has been a triumph, but the narrative is unnecessarily drawn out until the eighth episode. If the episodes were reduced more effectively, the show may have lasted longer than its first season.

      "Review 2499: The work of Asur defies succinct description. Expressing complex feelings with only one look. Smart forensics expert to kind father and husband to a terrifying Asur with whom he has emotional difficulties. This nail-biting suspense novel was superb. The script maintains interest throughout the whole running time. The score, composed and played superbly by Bickram Ghosh, was one of my favourite parts of the film. The score to the last scene was chilling. Asur was the last movie I watched. Congratulations to the whole crew, cast, and employees; the amount of study and the seamlessness with which it was incorporated into the development and execution of this masterwork are truly remarkable. Each and every second was fantastic!\n",
      "Review 2500: The performance of Asur is just too complicated to be described in a single word. Certain folks are accustomed to expressing complicated emotions with a single glance. Intelligent forensic specialist turned family man, currently dealing with his Fearsome Asur wife and their two small children emotionally. This page-turning thriller had me on the edge of my seat. The narrative keeps things entertaining throughout. Bickram Ghosh's soundtrack, which he created and performed flawlessly, was one of my favourite aspects of the entire experience. I got chills during the final scene with this background music. I just finished watching Asur. Mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology all play important parts in the creation and presentation of this masterpiece; congrats to everyone involved! Every syllable was soaked up by me!\n",

A handful of high-adrenaline set pieces between life and death produce an unusual sensation in the audience. Action is a series of scenes in which the protagonist takes centre stage and searches for corpses in exotic locales, and the sets are stunning; it generates suspense until the conclusion and is overall amazing.

INTRIGUING THINK-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING BEWITCHING.\n",
      "Review 2502: The title of Voot's newest series, \"asur,\" which means \"evil,\" relates to where evil initially originates in humanity. Anything takes precedence above anything else. The life-saving rage that wells up inside you. Some individuals may agree with you, while others may disagree with you. Beautiful work of melancholic words. Throughout the eight episodes, the story becomes more and more engrossing. Everything about the film is amazing, from the storyline to the direction to the acting. The entire performance of the group is outstanding. Obligatory and required adherence. Just three words: holy stuff! Isn't it incredible? What an exciting start for the Vote Choose system! That is the first Indian television show of its kind I've ever seen. The story, direction, and acting are all excellent. It successfully merges mythology with crime.\n",
      "Review 2503: After watching the show, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the greatest possible standard. It has to be released worldwide, not just in India. The work of his authors, which included Gaurav Shukla, was superb. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt are the writers. Suspense is constantly building in this show. You spend every second and minute wondering what will happen. Excellent setting for a Psycho villain. My curiosity in this series was peaked at once. The story's idea is interesting and puzzling, adding a new layer of mystery to an already compelling web series. This is a great web series that I like watching and have recommended to many of my friends.\n",
      "Review 2504: After seeing the performance, I can declare with certainty that it is of the greatest quality and class. It must be shown to audiences all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, the inventor and author, has done an outstanding job. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal are the writers. Suspense abounds in the series. You worry what will happen next every minute and second. Excellent overview of the Psycho personality. I was immediately drawn to this series upon first seeing it. It's really mind-boggling, and the story's idea is both exciting and perplexing, which adds to the intrigue of the web series. I constantly recommend this wonderful online series to my friends and like watching it myself.\n",
      "Review 2505: Current drama with fascinating mythological mixture. S2 is a well-made and suspenseful. The performance are top notch. The dialogues of this and the previous season was tremendous and the dialogue delivery was perfect. One of the smartest series ever. None of the scenes feel boring. The story is engaging. Story focuses on each and every characters very precisely. The performance of the cast is top notch, all the supporting actors gives their 100 percent. Arshad Warsi as DJ just rocked in the entire series. The way modern drama is connected with Mythology is just overwhelming is see. The additional element of the story is technology, which boost the writing. The big applause to all the negative characters depicted in the series. Special mention to Amey Wagh as Rasool who stole the heart in the entire story.\n",

I am always recommending this exceptional online series to my friends, and I also appreciate watching it myself.\n",
      "Review 2508: A awaited 2nd season, which is not give any disappointment. The makers tried to make this a masterpiece and they did it. In this 8 episode series there is no time u can eyes off from the screen. Arshad Warsi aka Dhanajay Rajput, his acting skill is so brilliant. The makers nicely mix the MYTH and TECHNOLOGY. The description of KALI and KALIJUG in this series is also so heart touching. How they comparing the recent days problems and their effects with MYTH is so dramatic. Through this series makers give a very meaningful advice to the society that we are growing rapidly using technology, but one day will come that will be the main reason for destruction of human beings.\n",
      "Review 2509: This web serial clearly benefited from careful production. Each successive layer of the story is equally intriguing. The great character portrayals and consistently excellent storylines across the episodes demonstrate the series' mastery of storytelling. The series serves as a sobering reminder of the far-reaching effects of contemporary conflict by showing its destructive outcomes. There should be more carefully crafted web series like this one produced by Hollywood. Therefore, I urge the producers to wrap up Season 3 as soon as possible. The script is superb, and the show is made much better by Arshad Warsi's captivating performance as the protagonist.\n",

A few intense sequences midway between living and dying leave viewers with an unsettling feeling. The set design is breathtaking, the plot keeps you guessing till the very end, and the action sequences, in which the protagonist takes centre stage and hunts for bodies in exotic settings, are nothing short of astounding. Very beautifully put together; kudos to the author! A must-watch for fans of the genre of Thriller! After viewing the full season, I have some thoughts to share about this programme. BEWITCHING INTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING AMAZING.\n",
      "Review 2511: Everyone there tried their best to ensure it would be an experience to remember. To Gaurav Shukla, with gratitude for this magnificent literary effort. We also want to extend our congratulations to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I'm looking forwards to seeing what comes next. The idea is brilliant. After a long hiatus, it was great to see Arsad Warsi again in cinematic form. It's a fantastic idea to have two realms fighting against one terrible power. Because of the bio, I decided to see the movie without first viewing the trailer. The story of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, two forensics professionals, as they follow the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur, is more than just a crime thriller. Our principles, beliefs, and values, as well as our responses to difficult situations, are all called into question.\n",
      "Review 2512: Asur's second season is a fascinating and complex story. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti give particularly impressive performances. The story moves quickly and keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the end. The show does a fantastic job of blending mythological and science fiction elements. The killer's reasons are fascinating and terrifyingly explained through the Vedas and other ancient literature. The series also investigates the potential risks of AI and how it may be exploited for evil. Here are some pros and cons of the show: Pros: *Excellent acting *Well-paced tale *Thrilling tension *Thought-provoking It combines mythology with technology. There are a few inconsistencies in the story and some mediocre visual effects.\n",
      "Review 2513: An editing mistake marred the scene in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriya torture another character. The writing in Asur is excellent; it kept me wondering right up to the very end. The entirety of Asur has been watched by me. I think it's great. Slow in spots, but worthwhile for learning about Indian mythology and the story's fundamental themes. Therefore, I felt no discomfort. After waiting for quite some time, I was able to see a compelling and suspenseful Hindi thriller. For the sake of the crowd and the fans, Arshad Warsi returns as Asur, this time on a digital screen. The script and direction of this picture are fantastic. The timing of the actors' movements is spot on. Everyone put forth their best effort to make it a night to remember. I appreciate your excellent work of literature, Gaurav Shukla. In addition, please extend my best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I'm eager to get started on the next task.\n",
      "Review 2514: This masterfully constructed web series effortlessly captivates its audience, drawing them into the story's intricate complexities. The extraordinary narrative talent of the series is demonstrated by the exceptional characterisation of multiple characters and the continuity between episodes. By exposing the destructive effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching consequences. The film industry must produce more web series with such high-quality screenplays. Therefore, I advise the creators to begin Season 3 production as soon as possible. The intriguing portrayal of the main character by Arshad Warsi adds to the series' perplexing nature, and the writing is excellent.\n",
      "Review 2515: There is a mistake in the editing of the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing another character. Asur is flawless in every way, yet I had no idea what was going on the entire time I was reading it. I'mcaught up on the entire run of Asur. It really stands out. Though it may drag at times, learning about Indian mythology is well worth the effort. That's why it didn't disturb me one bit. I finally got around to watching a gripping Hindi drama after a lengthy wait. Arshad Warsi, who played Asur previously, is shown on screen once again for the benefit of his fans. The screenplay and direction of this picture are fantastic. The action synchronisation of every single performer is flawless. Everyone there tried their best to ensure it would be an experience to remember. To Gaurav Shukla, with gratitude for this magnificent literary effort. We also want to extend our congratulations to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I'm looking forwards to seeing what comes next.\n",
      "Review 2516: The second season of Asur is a masterpiece of tension. The acting is superb, especially from Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti. Fast-paced action and unexpected twists will keep you wondering right up to the last page. Mythology and science are combined in a natural way throughout the show. The author's use of ancient texts like the Vedas to describe the murderer's motivations is fascinating and unsettling. The series also explores the potential for AI to be used for evil. Both the series' strengths and weaknesses are discussed below. Strengths: *Excellent acting* *A taut, suspenseful, and thought-provoking plot* *combines folklore with modern technologies. Weaknesses: *Poor visual effects (VFX) *There are a few kinks in the story.\n",
      "Review 2517: This web series has been painstakingly crafted to seamlessly grab its audience and draw them into the many depths of its story. The show's remarkable narrative abilities is on display in the nuanced representation of several characters and the consistent threading of plotlines between episodes. The show's depiction of the carnage caused by technological warfare is a sobering reminder of the far-reaching ramifications of such conflict. More web series with screenplays of this grade need to be produced by the film industry. Therefore, I beg the producers to work quickly on Season 3. Although the script might need some work, the series is saved by Arshad Warsi's hypnotic performance as the protagonist.\n",
      "Review 2518: Great work by Gaurav Shukla and Amazing performed by arshad warsi and Sobit. What an amazing work and writting of Gaurav shukla . Best cinematography and best direction. Story was quite interesting and full of thriller. Just Great work.\n",
      "Review 2519: Arshad Warsi, you made an excellent point. It has a great story and is expertly directed. All of the actors should be commended for their great performances. Finished Asur, the best scientifically and Hindu-mindedly oriented Hindi web series. The next sequel has my eager anticipation. Wow, great job there, dude. Asur will win every award this year. This web series has the best acting, the best direction, and the best storyline I have ever seen. What was I just talking about... I'll watch it when all the episodes are out, and you can probably predict what they did over the weekend. I haven't gotten over it yet... Just who is Kali, anyway? When is this going to end? A well-written piece will have you wondering what will happen next. All I can say is that I hope the time it takes writers and publishers isn't too long.\n",
      "Review 2520: Each everyone there gave their all to make it a night to remember. Thank you so much to Gaurav Shukla, who did a fantastic job penning this. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the crew also deserve credit for their great efforts. The next task is currently pending. The idea is incredibly sophisticated, and it was great to see arsad warsi back on TV after such a long hiatus. The idea of two universes fighting evil is fascinating. The synopsis sold me on the movie even before I saw the trailer. In pursuit of the serial murderer known only as \"Asur,\" forensic experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti play a game of cat-and-mouse. Our principles, beliefs, and values, as well as the choices we make in seemingly hopeless situations, are all called into question at various points.\n",
      "Review 2521: Arshad Warsi, you put an end to it. The premise is fantastic, and the film is well directed. Each and every one of the actors gave a terrific performance. Asur, the best Hindi web series ever, has now ended. It mixes scientific enquiry with Hindu tenets. Wow, great job, bud! When will there be a sequel? This year, all the honours will go to Asur. All aspects of this web series, including the acting, production, and story, have been given a flawless score of 10 out of 10. And to think, I just finished... Now that I know all the episodes will eventually be released, I plan to watch it. They dropped them on Saturday. I haven't gotten over it yet... Where does Kali come from? Will this ever stop? The author's superb wordcraft will have you wondering what happens next. Creators and publishers, please don't take too long; I'm praying.\n",
      "Review 2522: I would rank this among the greatest Bollywood movies I've ever watched. Superb performance all around, but especially from DR. BARUN SOBTI (my particular favourite). Although I enjoy watching American web series, this has piqued my interest in Indian films and television. I'm anticipating the next season with the same high expectations. There are no spoilers here, but I feel obligated to mention one nonetheless, so please check out this masterpiece anyhow. This is more than just a suspenseful read. It's an intellectual hoax. The story has progressed nicely at the halfway mark, and you're left wanting more. To call this show a \"psychological thriller\" would be an understatement.\n",
      "Review 2523: After viewing the performance, I can confidently assert that it is among the finest in the world. It should be shown not only to Indian audiences, but to the entire globe. Both the creator and the writers, both named Gaurav Shukla, did an excellent job. The authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The Thrilling and Thrilling series. Every waking moment, you fret about the future. The character of Psycho was introduced effectively. When I first saw this series, I was immediately captivated. It's wonderful, and the concept is both intriguing and perplexing, making for an intriguing web series. I've been telling all of my peers about this web series due to its high quality.\n",
      "Review 2524: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited. After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. SPELLBOUNDINGINTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING I can say with confidence that the performance is of the highest quality and standard. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupriyi Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amuy wagh effectively supervised the work of Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The concert will forever remain in your memory. I eagerly anticipate the second season.\n",
      "Review 2525: Regarding effectiveness, Asur defies concise summarization. The quantity of emotion conveyed with a single gaze was astounding. He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely.\n",
      "Review 2526: Arshad Warsi, you nailed it. It has abrilliant plot and is expertly executed. All of the characters played their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy. Outstanding effort, friend! I cannot wait for the next episode! This year, every award will go to Asur. In terms of acting, production, and story, this web series obtains a faultless score of ten. What have I just completed... I was determined to view this once all episodes were available, and guess what? They were made available during the weekend. I'm still not over it... Who is Kali exactly? When is this going to end? Clever writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the amount of time taken by creators and publishers is reasonable.\n",
      "Review 2527: You are absolutely correct, Arshad Warsi. It's well executed, and the narrative is superb. The entire ensemble did a fantastic job with their respective roles. The finest Hindi web series, Asur, is a masterful synthesis of scientific and Hindu philosophical themes. My interest is piqued, and I anticipate the next installment with great anticipation. This year, Asur will win every award possible. This web series gets a perfect 10 because it features outstanding performances, direction, and story. I can't believe I finally managed to finish it. This weekend, when all the episodes are released, is excellent because that's when they shot it, so I'll give it a go then. The shock has only just worn off... Identify Kali and explain what he is. How long can this keep happening? Good writing keeps the reader wondering right up to the final page. Hopefully, production and distribution won't take too long.\n",
      "Review 2528: The series stands out for its absence of profanity and sexism. The fun may be shared with the whole family. If you can devote seven or eight hours to watching this series, you will not be let down. Last but not least, the direction and cinematography are top-notch. Not a single link in the chain is weak. The praise from Asur is well deserved. Nothing about this is weak. I woke up with a severe Asur hangover today. There's some eerie music at the beginning and finish. I can't stop hearing that in my mind. One of the finest concerts I've ever been to, in all honesty. The plot, the directing, and the performances were all top-notch. Asur was completed in a one sitting. I've never watched a whole Web series in one sitting before. At last, an intelligent show that can hold its own against westerns. Please accept my sincere appreciation for the excellent performance.\n",
      "Review 2529: As a series name, \"asur\" refers to the emergence of evil within the human psyche. The reorganisation of priorities. How far your inner asur will go to defend you. It is possible that your concept only applies to you and not to others. A tale of despair that is masterfully crafted. There are a total of eight episodes, and each one delves deeply into the story. I was amazed by everything, from the plot to the performances. The collective labour of the group is truly astounding. It must absolutely be seen. Holy smokes!! Is all that is necessary. Is this not a lengthy series? What an excellent beginning for Voot choose! This type of Indian television programme has never been broadcast in the United States. The script, direction, and performances were all outstanding. It is a wonderful blend of mystery and folklore.\n",
      "Review 2530: Everyone exerted their utmost effort to make the evening memorable. I admire the quality of your literary work, Gaurav Shukla. Please also convey my best wishes to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the team. I am anxious to begin the next assignment. This is an excellent concept. It was wonderful to see Arsad Warsi in a film again after a lengthy absence. Incredible is the concept of two planets uniting to vanquish a common foe. The description was sufficient to convince me to watch the film without first viewing a trailer. The tale of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, two forensic specialists on the trail of the self-proclaimed serial murderer Asur, is more than a simple crime thriller. Our ideals, beliefs, and values, as well as our responses to adversity, are all called into doubt.\n",
      "Review 2531: When you consider the series' acting, plotting, aesthetics, music, and story, you'll agree that it's fantastic. Everyone from Arshad Warsi to Barun Sobti to Anupriya Goenka to Abhishek Chauhan to Ridhi Dogra to Meiyang Chang to Amey Wagh to Pawan Chopra did a fantastic job. There is no question that this series deserves the award. It's the kind of show that sticks with you, and it could make you wonder if the values we hold dear are really the right ones. This show has gone above and beyond to blend science fiction and fantasy elements. I urge you to see it and say unequivocally that the third season is something I will eagerly anticipate. This mind-bending suspense book will leave you thinking long after you've finished it. The preview does not do the film credit. Everything from mythology to forensic psychology to score-worthy score music to a mind-blowing script. Do not pass up this chance.\n",
      "Review 2532: It is a mind-blowing series because of the acting, plot, aesthetics, music, and, most importantly, the story. All of the actors, Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra, gave outstanding performances. This series will certainly receive the honour. It's the type of series that makes you question what is right and whether what we believe to be right is actually accurate. The creators of this series exerted substantial effort to combine technology and myth. Highly recommended...watch it, and certainly, you should look forwards to the third season. This is a mind-boggling suspense novel that will provoke thought. The trailer does not do justice to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensics, excellent background music, and an outstanding screenplay/plot. This should not be ignored.\n",
      "Review 2533: Alternately, the actors, the director, and the music. Certainly worthy of observing. The second season is anxiously awaited.

      "Review 2534: Asur 2 is an episode-by-episode mythological thriller with incredible developments. Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team are routinely duped by a recurring gang of swindle artists. Arshad Warsi has done the character justice, who is so ingeniously crafted. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh share a similar situation. The premise of the show is perfectly adapted to the underlying principle (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the combination of legendary tales. Other members of the Starcast have also performed admirably, but certain passages are so lengthy as to be superfluous and extend the narrative until episode eight. If the editing had been precise, six episodes would have been sufficient for this programme. Hacking Sequences is a 30-minute brief episode in which Anupriya Gokhale implements algorithms created by nerds for geeks.\n",
      "Review 2535: This series is distinguished by its lack of immorality and foul language. It is appropriate for family entertainment. This course will not disappoint if you devote 7-8 hours to it. Moreover, the performances and cinematography are also exceptional. There is not a single flaw in the series. Asur is not only a popular series, but it also merits its popularity. This contains no flaws; everything is ideal. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. Beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It has become ingrained in my mind. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot resist praising the screenplay, direction, and acting. I watched Asur in a single day. I have never before completed a Web series in a single day. Finally, a programme with Western intelligence. Thank you for creating such an outstanding series.\n",

      "Review 2537: Asur's malice may be misunderstood by some. The most recent stories deserve more votes. The series' title alludes to the asur within a person's body. The order of importance has changed. Your animosity is becoming more apparent now. Some people might agree with you, while others could disagree. The writing in this tragic tale was superb. Over the course of the eight episodes, the story develops and grows. You remember the dialogue and the acting vividly. The team's passion blows my mind. Certainly worthy of being noted. How much meaning can you communicate in only three words? Wow, that was one amazing performance. Vote Select seems to be working so far. This is unlike anything that has ever been seen on Indian television. Everything about it was top-notch, from the writing to the direction to the performances. The blend of mythology and crime is skilfully handled.\n",
      "Review 2538: Asur's second season is a polished and suspenseful drama. In particular, Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobsi'sportrayals stand out. The story is expertly paced, keeping the reader wondering until the very end. Mythology and modern technology work well together in this show. It'sfascinating and unnerving that the author resorts to ancient writings like the Vedas to explain the killer's actions. The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil...Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are subpar. Several plot flaws.\n",
      "Review 2539: No other Bollywood movie has impressed me as much as this one. Superb performances from everyone involved, especially BARUN SOBTI, who I adore. This is Arshad Warsi at his very best; I can't wait for season two. I can't remember the last time I saw a web series as good as this one. I usually watch American web series, but this gets me curious about Bollywood films and shows. I'm hoping season two lives up to the high standards set by the first. This post does not include any spoilers, but I feel obligated to discuss one anyhow. However, I shall not do so here, as the film truly is an art form. There's more to this series than just suspense. It'sintellectually stimulating. The story progresses nicely, and the middle of the series will definitely have you wanting more. The term \"psychological thriller\" does not do justice to the quality of this show.\n",
      "Review 2540: It is an exceptional show due to the acting, writing, structure, aesthetics, music, and, yes, the plot. All of the actors, from Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti to AnupriyaGoenka and Abhishek Chauhan and Riddhi Dogra and Meiyang Chang and Amey Wagh and Pawan Chopra, performed admirably. There is no doubt that this performance will win the award. This is the type of programme that might make you question whether or notthe things you take for granted are accurate. In its integration of mythology and technology, this series has gone well below the surface. I cannot recommend it highly enough; you should undoubtedly try it out. A mind-blowing suspense novel that keeps the reader guessing until the very end. The trailer does not do justice to the film. Mythology, psychology, forensic science, an outstanding melody, and a well-written script. There is an opportunity you should not pass up.\n",
      "Review 2541: Or the Actors, Filmmakers, and Musicians. Certainlysomething to investigate. Patiently awaiting the second season. After watching the entire season of this programme, I feel qualified to provide descriptive language. STUNNING BREATHTAKING MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC After seeing the performance, I can say with confidence that it is among the finest in the world. It should be screened not only for Indian audiences, but for all of humanity. Excellent work by both the inventor and the authors named Gaurav Shukla. Outstanding performances by Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, SharibHashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh in a production by Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal, directed by Oni Sen. If you see the performance, it will leave an indelible impression on you. Season 2 is anxiously anticipated by me.\n",
      "Review 2542: In the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character, there is an editing error. Asur is exceptional in every way; the writing alone kept me guessing until the very end. I viewed every episode of Asur in a single session. This is remarkable. The occasionally languid pace provides the reader more time to absorb the Indian mythology and story. So, I had no issues with it. I finally watched a Hindi suspense film that kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi reunites with Asur on film, much to the delight of his fans. This film's script and direction are both excellent. All of the performers have impeccable synchronisation. Everyone who contributed did their best to make it exceptional. We owe Gaurav Shukla a debt of gratitude for his well-written article. Thanks are also extended to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the incredible team. In anticipation of the next assignment.\n",
      "Review 2543: Asur 2 is the pinnacle of mythological suspense, keeping you on the edge of your seat with each new episode's disclosures about the cunning villendescendants who continue to con Dhanjay rajpoot and his crew. Arshad Warsi performed admirably as the well-written character. The same holds true for both Amey wagh and Varun Arora. The legendary narrative and the program's underlying concept (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) are a perfect match. The remainder of the Starcast has also performed admirably, but the story meanders until episode 8. If the editing had been better, this programme might have ended after the first season. Anupriya Goenka's Hacking Scenes, Collected The programme will last only 30 minutes, and she will (jokingly) execute algorithms created by geeks for nerds.\n",
      "Review 2544: Is it because we're becoming more isolated and lonely in this high-tech, scientific society that we're more likely to fall for con artists who put up a good front but are really want your power and your thoughts. An exotic atmosphere is achieved by interspersing a few of action passages with tense, terrifying pauses. An action film where the protagonist gets most of the screen time and investigates gruesome murders in exotic locations with breathtaking vistas. Excellent plan, expertly executed. An absolute must-watch for genre aficionados. Now that I've seen the full season, I can confidently describe this show. OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY PHENOMENAL.\n",
      "Review 2545: The term asur may be confounded with the name, but it signifies evil. A new #voot series. The series' title alludes to how asur manifests within humans. How one priority gives way to another. How your inner scoundrel seems to save you. Your belief may be appropriate for one individual but inaccurate for another. A very well-written tale of melancholy. Each of the eight episodes contributes to the progression and development of the narrative. Both the performance and dialogue are incomprehensible. The dedication of the staff is admirable. Must and cannot be skipped. Oh my goodness, just three sentences! What an incredible series! What an auspicious beginning for Voot select! I've never seen anything like this on Indian television before. The plot, direction, and acting were all outstanding. It is a wonderful combination of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 2546: I think the best part of this series is it's suspense. No doubt everyone like this series. I think this series want to show everyone the bad side of human being. Everyone is asur but humans are release the form of asur is a right time. My favourite part of this series is the concept of AI. This movie want to show anyone the bad side of technology as well as Ai. This is not a only mithologycal series this series contains many of bad side of human. Only asur is not Kali,Kali is everyone and this series show this sence properly. I think this is the awesome thriller series and I am very much enjoying this series. So, many many thanks director sir for gift a awesome suspense thriller series.üëçüëç\n",
      "Review 2547: The story of ASUR picks up from mythology and gradually advances to technology and Artificial Intelligence, the fundamental pillars of today's time showcasing the evolution and emergence of mankind of the day. Not just a brilliant concept but a mind baffling, intricate and meticulously executed script. This is phenomenal! It seeps to such depths of your conscience and strings those chords of your nerves you are hardly aware of it existing in the regular, tedious days of ones life. In the story SHUBH transpires to be a genius who puts the entire nation at sixes and sevens, though when looked from a broader aspect is just a fictitious character but the ingenuity which carved the role is most definitely not very much tangible. The person or/and the team behind this eccentric writing most precisely hold the capacity to knock you off your feet.! ASUR is a masterpiece and SOMETHING LIKE NEVER BEFORE!\n",

      "Review 2551: After finishing 2nd season , i was just blown away . What a show it was .... The thing that attracted me to this web series is the fact it is based on a mythological crime drama and it is one of its kind to come out in India. The creators unique storytelling pace , its very engaging and keep you on the hook for a cat and mouse chase. Arshad Warsi is brilliant as the protagonist and the child who played the character as shubh was amazing. I felt the second season is better than the first and the character development was also very good . The pace is very fast in the second season rather than the first . Overall one of the best tv series i have watched in a while.\n",
      "Review 2552: Direction to story line , acting to screen play, every moment of the serise is awesome. One of the best thriller. If sacred game is defination of Indian thriller, then I can say definitely 'sacrrd Game' is nothing compare to 'Asur'.A serial kiling story linked by Indian Mythology. Awesome\n",
      "Review 2553: To begin with I am speechless. Dialogues, screenplay, acting - phenomenal. Best part if the script - the way story unfolds, small suspense, thrillers.\n",
      "Review 2554: The show thrives on fast-paced, intelligent writing complemented by credible & nuanced acting by all actors. As characteristic of Indian cinema, the plot is riddled with plot holes, but you don't get affected by it as the premise of the show, which is a mix of Hindu mythology, crime thrill and some emotional baggage, dominates the screen. Must watch!\n",
      "Review 2555: Genre is good as it is fresh in TV but there are loop holes in the script. End is illogical.\n",
      "Review 2556: The series is very good but I think I could be more better I feel like it is inspired by Hollywood movie series SAW. And the main villain casting is not good his acting not that good but his friend or vo villian is very good actor and story is very good feel very proud that now there is very good content made in bollywood or web series.\n",
      "Review 2557: #AsurI have never seen a series with so much plot holes. I just don't want to say anything. Personally I wouldn't recommend a watch! If my friend doesn't recommended or strongly argued for this I could never have watched beyond the second episode! The amateurish direction, over the top acting, lacklustre CGI and beyond believable incompetent investigate officers! I could go on! There was no logic in the storyline whatsoever!May be there was a good plot somewhere but it was so lost in all those bad things that I found it so hard to find any positive! I can go on forever what's bad in this but bottomline is I didn't liked anything from this, may be the only good episode was the very first episode. After that logic is thrown out of the window and I'm still trying to find what's thrilling!\n",

It's similarly dim and abhorrent as a kid gives indications of wickedness and proceeds to gather fingers after each murder, drawing matches with Angulimala - the heartless legendary rascal who kept the check of his homicides by gathering fingers.

      "Review 2595: The best part about the series was, what i felt that team had worked really hard and put so much effort to bring out the drama and the suspense and thriller which made the audience laugh, and made emotional at times...the horror is the most beautiful part on screen and this series is a must watch.\n",
      "Review 2596: I started this show with zero expectation. because i thought that this is first voot original and it is going to be same like crime petrol. but as the show started it grips me and i was on edge of seat throughout the show.let's starts with story and plot. this was something unique and new for our Indian market as we like to watch shows which are based on western mythology like witcher or crown. but this series brings Indian mythology to forensic science and create a perfect blend of mythological thriller. i am not going to give you any hint about the show because it is an experience which can only be felt by an individual to bring out the best fun. so overall the story was unique , brilliant and something which you naver had an exoerience\n",
      "Review 2597: Watch this amazing content. The efforts put into this are worthy. Hats off to the team\n",
      "Review 2598: It is superb watching material. Connects mythology to us.\n",
      "Review 2599: It's over hyper certainly. It's a good watch and the way they connected mythology was good. But lot of things are neglected. The proper reason wasn't justified and the acting of a few lead actors seemed fake. It's a good watch for the Hindi audience but for others you will run out of patience. It seemed incomplete. The first two ep had it hooked but later it was just a drag. A honest attempt but failed to capitalise on what could have been a brilliant series.\n",
      "Review 2600: It's a suspense thriller with too much of happening around. Wonderful it's just smart writing\n",
      "Review 2601: Amazing acting by Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti. Really new experience seeing this amazing series.

      "Review 2603: Its one of the best ever psycho-thriller series! FANTASTIC concoction of hindu mythology and serial killing!! Arshad Warsi was awesome, as expected, but the TV superstar Barun Sobti was unbelievably good!! I never knew that besides being a hunky, he acts so well! üòç he has all the elements to be a great asset to bollywood.\n",
      "Review 2604: I have not watched a Indian show as mind blowing as Asur. I binge watched this show, once you start you will watch it till the end & it will not disappoint you, it is that good.It is a well researched & written show & the actors are at top notch level.Barun Sobti as Nikhil Nair was the best in the show, his vulnerability, his helplessness at some point was portrayed so beautifully.... when he cries he makes others cry with himArshad Warsi this was the first time I have seen him in a serious role & he did copmlete justice to itSpecial mention to Vishesh bansal...he was terrific as Shubh\n",
      "Review 2605: It explores the less explored world of forensic science and exploits Indian mythology. One of the best series I have seen so far and definitely very intriguing. Go give it a watch. You will love it for sure. Highly recommended\n",
      "Review 2606: Saw all the episodes of asur with just one word to say to the team.. no word hats off and the acting of each character is just Dhasu My Salute to each and every star who worked in Asur.\n",

But this one is just exceptional brilliant and different to all the shows and movies I have ever watched. The basic concept of this series is similar to Sacred Games. Yet it is the far better take on that concept as compared to sacred games. Please go and give it a watch. It is a binge worthy series.\n",

      "Review 2611: Everybody has a dark side, good and bad. Asur, a mythological crime thriller, loved it but the last episodes lost the momentum but the story does not end here waiting for more episodes. Giving it 9 stars because it deserves it.\n",

      "Review 2613: Finally Watched Asur, an amazing series with a perfect combination of mythology, human psychology and science writer Gaurav you had done a very hard work on the script of asur and it is visible there. All the actors were superb. But Arshad Warsi & Barun Sobti were fire\n",
      "Review 2614: I love the performances of the full cast everyone is so naturaland perfect with each take.Dhananjay Rajpoot is as real as he always does. The stress DhananjayRajpoot feels can be seen through his eyes only.Nikhil Nair looks very handsome although his clumsy hairstyle isawkward. Also, he has given a superb performance.Lolark Dubay keeps you entertain with his funny cum friendly character.Naina Nair, wife of Nikhil Nair leaves her mark brilliantly.Nusrat Saeed is very good as per her scope.The guy who played Shubh Joshi's childhood role speaks with his eyesand 10/10 to that kid. Rest of the supporting cast is superb which make above performances even more impacting\n",

      "Review 2617: This is something that would take Indian web series to a whole new level. We can watch this series with family because it doesn't have too much abusing and scenes.If we describe this series in one word, it would be BRILLIANT and mesmerizing. The story is something you could get stick to it once started watching. What a splendid performance from Arshad Warsi and other casts.Final verdict: It's a must watch for everyone who wants to get best utilization of their time. Believe me you are not going to regret. This is certainly competing the level of Scared games and Mirzapur and light side on abuse and offensive scenes.\n",
      "Review 2618: The cast suits the role and have acted very well. They make the story so believable. A good watch!!\n",
      "Review 2619: Everything went so well in the series.. Brilliant acting by Arshad (as always) and Barun Sobti was good too. And the thrill level was too good. You just can't get up from your seat to watch the end and finally when the end arrives it really disappoints you....Really Not Up To The Mark\n",
      "Review 2620: After a long time seen such amazing show i didn't expected it to be so good it was just amazing\n",
      "Review 2621: The main thing which attracted me to this series is it's story. The story buildup is incredible. Direction is slow but it's OK to give it a try. Enjoyed watching this series.\n",
      "Review 2622: This is such a wondeful series. The actors have done such a great job. Ardhad warsi at its best. This series has such amazing potential. I just loved the plot. The cast is so hardworking. I hope atleast 10 seasons come of this series. I will binge watch it again and again. The most amazing stroyline the most amazing cast.\n",
      "Review 2623: I saw the IMDB rating 9 and quickly watched it. Series has 8 episodes and it's kind of slow till 3 episodes. It doesn't thrill you till 5th episode and it catches upon you on 6th episode. Last episode is final encounter with antagonist.Though it will have next seasons. Creators tried too much to create thrill .Storyline is fine but it has loopholes. A common brain can catch the loopholes like I waited for face recognition of antagonist through the software from 4th episode to 6th episode.Nowhere near to Sacred Games and please let's not talk about True Detective.Eventhe creators of True detective cannot remake another True Detective(S01). Statements comparing ASUR with True Detective is laughable.Its a good series but sooner you realise the shallowness of the execution of story or plot. Its just like Hindu mythology(various interpretations) good to hear and listen but makes less meaning and sense.\n",
      "Review 2624: It's brilliant combination of suspense thrill and mythology\n",
      "Review 2625: Best best. Asur is India's best series..it must be dubbed in international languages like money heist.

It's great combination of crime with mythology.No other actor would have played better in any of the characters it's unbelievable that they could pull off something like this.Just splended.\n",
      "Review 2627: Brilliant movie , kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The pacing and flow of the movie is great at eliciting the thrilled emotion.\n",
      "Review 2628: This series has pushed me to put efforts to rate it 10 stars because of its amazing story telling. Although little bit on hacking side is shown to be more childish in some cases. In some its authentic and convincing. Arshad warsi has been just one of the character which made it a treat to watch everyone playing their part. Real events so convincingly put together like it seems it must have happened in real. Making you believe probably it would have. Pushing myself to delete these social media apps. They are actually having so much data of ours its getting scary. Overall Sunday well spend. Must MUST WATCH...\n",
      "Review 2629: Asur is really the best series in India till date, June 2023. When asur season 1 come, there is so many questions remaining in mind of every person whom watched the season 1. In june 2023 season 2 is back with twist and surprises, the writer and director play with viewers mind all the time. You are not bore for 1 second in all 8 episode, and till last minute you don't know the real plan of asur (called shubh joshi). And makers give all us a very special gift to be safe with our phone and social media.\" Social media is current time madira \".And all the cast played a very good role, best combination of writing, casting, acting, script. At last very good use of hindu mythology and hindi language.\n",

      "Review 2632: The web series is all about a psychopath a killer who make you feel like he is a real asur. Who is compiled with old beliefs and a killing people in such different ways we really never thought this perfect crime.So the serie has 2 main characters Arshad warsi and barun sobtiWho are from CBI and works in forensic department who solve case. Both of them have past. The killer is all related with it and challenges them. As the story goes on they get to know its just what crazzy a asur can be.\n",

      "Review 2636: Inimitable, erratic, invincible and a flabbergasted art of writing & execution.Each & everyone associated to it gave best to make it unforgettable. Special thanks to Gaurav Shukla for the great piece of writing art. Also to great work of Niren Bhatt ,Abhijit & complete team. Waiting for the next project.\n",
      "Review 2637: Arshad first series and super HIT. It's like Arshad has made himself Guaranteed Hit of bollywood. It is based on an unknown social subject and all have nailed it with utmost fun. Must watch.\n",
      "Review 2638: ASUR is an extremely well directed and well scripted web series based on a very thought provoking story. It keeps the viewers captivated throughout. The title completely justifies the story. The message has been portrayed in an excellent manner. From the direction to acting to dialogues, everything is top notch! It's a must watch thriller.

      "Review 2641: I have binged all the episodes of Asur It's so damn good. It's a little slow at points but gives you time to understand the story better and the Indian Mythology. So I didn't mind it. After a really long time saw a thriller hindi show, which held up till last,has the power to hold you inBrilliant screenplay and work by actorsCrazyyyy concept\n",

It has an unique story line which contains mystery, drama, and thrilling suspenses. The cinematography of this series is just mind blowing. All the actors have executed their roles perfectly.

      "Review 2651: This is my first review and I was compelled to make an id on IMDb for this webseries. We all have praised the Netflix, Prime webseries of foreign languages , but this series ( to be very frank I didn't expect much from this while starting) keeps you on the edge of the seat and the interesting and captivating mix of forensic science and Indian Mythology is something you can't afford to miss!! Kota Factory was promising and there has been Tripling and Pitchers as well in India but this is altogether a new genre and it does look extremely promising. Waiting for the new season , hope voot brings that soon and yes A New Era of Indian Web Series Begins!\n",

      "Review 2656: Simply one of the best of its genera. Keeps you engaging from the very first episode and obviously till the end. Heavy dialogues, meticulous scientifically explained killings and lively performances.Nearly every character have lived up to expectations. My ratings must be 9.5 or more out of 10, but above all it has an impact on ur mind. Overall positive user reviews too are 96percent highest for an indian web series.The dialogues are deeply meaningful and makes u rewinding at times.High magnetic field making an iron implant a projectile, venom getting vascular access via ulcer, the comma cocktail, phenobarb use, cigarette withdrawal symptoms and many small things have a rational medical explanations.Congratulations all the asur team and viacom. Seriously waiting for next seasons..\n",
      "Review 2657: Good story, good cast and good execution. Story starts with Shubh who was shown as Asur who kills good people to call Kalki- Vishnu's Avatar early. Cinematography is good, suspense maintained till end.\n",

      "Review 2663: Why is no one talking about this series , I really started watching first episode with no expectation at all and ended up watching 7 episodes in a row.. I haven't watched final episode yet so I really hope they give it proper ending ..Arshad warsi is an underrated actor and he is just awesome in whole series and frankly him and barun were the main reason I started watching this series , direction and story is on the point.. every episode makes you think whats gonna happen next .Barun sobti is one of my favourite actors of star tv shows... I still remember his portrayal of arnub from his show \"Iss pyaar ko kya naam doon\" , so watching him again after so many time was a treat that I didn't know I wanted..Direction is pretty good and I really don't know much about director and his earlier work but he really managed to show his potential and if there is a second season I really wish they don't mess this up.\n",

      "Review 2667: The direction is amazing and has portrayed a beautiful message to the society. The ancient Indian mythology has been used in an appropriate manner to add to the rich content. It is set in Banaras. This web series is a psychological crime drama focused on ruthless murders by a serial killer. The officers are given the task to do justice the case ahead of them. Do watch it.\n",
      "Review 2668: I only watched it for #Barunsobti and he really did very well also all actors did so well. You always will be my favourite barun.And the story of the so is brilliant I never watch any other show like this.So guys go and watch it on Voot I am sure you definitely like to.\n",
      "Review 2669: Some of the decisions made by the characters cannot be chalked down to logical human thought process boundaries, neither emotionally nor rationally. The series ends up leaving a lot of questions unanswered. There's a lot that the series merely touches upon, but does not explore.\n",
      "Review 2670: It has its peaks as it plays out its series of action beats and fight sequences with a comedic flair. Taking into consideration what makes up the basic buddy movie formula, Audrey is a film that looks great on paper.\n",

      "Review 2679: -Great story line and a nice new form to collate mythology with science seen in this series.Story of a psychopathic spiritual man who is on a mythical mission by taking on forensic science as a rival / a partner - that could be understood only by watching the series.-Some bits and pieces just flew away without any point in the story making it unnecessary in the plot.-Unpredictable scenes found in most of the story which turns out to be good.-A slow start in the story with good escalation in the latter episodes which builds up the excitement but fails to deliver.-A must watch for people wanting something exciting, thrilling and different.-Arshad, Vishesh bansal and Anupriya Goenka had great performance. Other casts were average.\n",
      "Review 2680: Asur is a mind blowing thriller. Two officers have to find a serial killer before it's too late. It has a twisted plot.

      "Review 2690: A mix of CID, Crime Patrol and Sacred Games, the web show doesn't disappoint and performs well in the first two episodes. However, with six more episodes to go, it seems to follow the success formula of Sacred Games but with comparatively less thrill and chaos\n",

      "Review 2692: The second season is handsomely packaged with some fascinating sub-plots, more devious and unexpected twists and full of thriller. Asur Season 2 takes the intriguing story forward, exploring the connection between myths, technology, and human psychology.about redemption, revenge and regrets. Hidden purposes have been unraveled and the mystery to find that demonic child Shubh continues. Asur season 2 begins by showcasing that Warsi's Dhananjay \"DJ\" Rajpoot has taken exile in a monastery to find solace after he lost his wife as well as friend and investigative officer Lolark Dubey (Sharib Hashmi) to the killer.

      "Review 2705: This series was Beyond imagination üî•Lagaav hi peeda hai, karuna hi kroorata hai, aur ant hi praarambh,\" we hear Asur recite these lines many times in the series. It means - attachment is pain, compassion is cruelty, and the end is the beginning. However, without emotions, attachment and compassion, humanity ceases to exist. Exactly! And that's what the Asur AKA Shubh Joshi wants, who is back for revenge with his lethal plan to destroy the world. In the second season, however, it is only the technology that remains as mythology takes a backseat. We discover that Shubh, with the help of a Professor, has built an AI neural network which can predict future events. It is revealed that this network helped him successfully execute his plan and past murders, as the AI model helped him stay one step ahead of the CBI. Given the rise of ChatGPT in the real world and ethical concerns around artificial intelligence, the premise seems not only reasonable but also relevant to the present day.\n",

Why do we value our loved ones less than we depend on them? What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.\n",

      "Review 2832: How can someone miss out one of the main character's name #TheAsur played by Vishesh Bansal. It is very sad to not see the deserved accolades for your favourite characters that guy as compared to his age has done the fabulous acting in the series at par with Arshad warsi and Barun Sobti. It is not fair to not give credit for a person's work. Actors work there ***off to see their name on the screen when a movie/series starts.I would have given it 10 stars but I'm upset!!\n",
      "Review 2833: Every episode, that is directed by Oni Sen and is currently streaming in Voot Select, begins with a glimpse into the past of the mysterious killer. Asur is both alluring and compelling enough in its first season to binge-watch it at one go.

Easily recommended!\n",
      "Review 2834: I'm generally not a fan of web series as they are long and I loose my interest after some time. But with Asur, i had a different experience. I saw its advertisement on television and I was instantly drawn. Surprisingly, I finished the series in just a day.Asur is not just a thiller drama, it is more of a psychology that plays with your mind and takes your breath away. The mystical plot combined with science and Indian mythology makes you want more. The decision of basing the storyline on Indian mythology was an intelligent one as there are so many darker aspects of our mythology that we are not aware of and Arshad Warsi's strong acting is a cherry on top. What more can I say? I'm just going to spend the rest of my days waiting for the second season. Yes, that's a good reason to keep going..\n",

I believe when you are a great fan of the Amish Tripathi storylines, which are just the perfect blend of technology and mythological epics, you are just bound to love Asur.The direction is good, the acting is brilliant and the storyline is just spectacular. Watch it in an isolated settins with no disturbances and full concentration.\n",
      "Review 2836: Its a well scripted, fantastically directed TV series. The best part is Mythological connections of events which are so well mixed up that you can't wait to watch next episode. The story telling is fantastic. The serial killings based movie, which I watched before this was \"Ratsasan\" and Ratsasan i consider as masterpiece. Asur is of that level to attain the best title. A must watch TV series if you felt cheated after Bollywood's n Netflix's recent kachraa.\n",
      "Review 2837: Very beautifully choreographed. Scene transformation is incredible. How they display the cpnnection of crime and the concept of ASUR is appreciative.After a long time a series came so strong and so impressive. Its so hard to leave this series in between...but alas i have to ...to cook... so bad...\n",

      "Review 2850: The web series is an amalgamation of Indian folklore fables and forensic science. On the show, Barun plays the role of a CBI forensic expert-turned-forensic teacher at FBI. The web series doesn't disappoint and keeps the viewers glued to the show till the end.\n",
      "Review 2851: Yes, this isn't perfect. But should we be really demanding mona lisa where web series are just made by putting together C grade scenes. We rarely get to see some well crafted work where writers, directors and actors really put their effort into their work. Sacred games was one of them and yes this is one of them. Everyone did their work honestly and whole-heatedly. It might disappoint some people because there is certain buildup for next season. but fine for me, because glad to see that there's more coming. Go for it, you'll enjoy this,\n",

      "Review 2885: The psychological thriller is a murder mystery with enough of charred and mutilated bodies. The eponymous asur, generally referred to a mythological barbarian with not even an iota of goodness, is a serial killer who is being pursued by a forensic expert Nikhil Nair\n",
      "Review 2886: Asur is all about compilation of myth, science, and investigation, narrated with rootedness and a great eye for detailing. Actors and their dialogues are mind-blowing and had left a great impact on the audience.\n",
      "Review 2887: Most thriller series running in india right now.This series became attractive to me at the first sight. It is absolutely mindblowing and the plot of the story is also interesting and confusing at the same time which makes the web series even more interesting. I always recommend my friends to watch this incredible web series and I also myself love watching it too.\n",
      "Review 2888: Asur does a wonderful job of portraying how people pick their character. It's a treat for people interested in philosophy, psychology and probably for any human who is interested in deeper aphorisms.However, it would be a disservice to just call it that as there is a lot more going on underneath what's visible.As the series throws mythology, forensic jargons and outright surprises your way, you would be glad to have watched it. If I may add as well, in the end Asur is another attempt ongoing over ages at displaying how objective reality turns subjective.Finally the actors have done absolute justice to bringing their characters to life. The solid performance just adds to a plot which is rare to come across, especially in our country\n",
      "Review 2889: I watched Asur today and that too I binge watched it . It's so addicting that I cannot hold myself from watching it. I just sat and started watching it and end up watching all the episodes. It's so tempting and exciting to watch that you cannot hold yourself from not watching it. The thrill storyline and the direction is at par and all of it is worth watching . Must watch\n",
      "Review 2890: Asur has a creative and a thrilling storyline. A brilliantly written story, be it the Psychopathic killer or the ingenious officers charged with the case. The mythological twist adds another set of flavours to this series. As the story progresses, it grabs on more and more to you, from the pilot story all the way to the end. What a performance by Arshad! Overall great direction and an even greater performance by the actors! A must watch!\n",
      "Review 2891: Asur is a new age story which uniquely blends science and mythology with the most eye catching and nail biting scenes.Arshad warsi and Barun Sobti are at their best.The overall use of lighting to create depth in the story intricately is much appreciated.\n",
      "Review 2892: Asur',really it is a kind of masterpiece by Pavel after 'Rosogolla' . The script(though it has some flaws) keeps you engaged through out the movie.This movie is an epitome of bengali art and culture. And acting wise saying, Jeet has rediscovered himself as an actor, He reminds us about the mad artist Ramkinkar Baij, this is his best work till date, people who say he can't act should go and watch the film,And Nusrat too has given a stellar performance,and Aabir acting as a pro, not unusual for him!A must watch\n",

What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it?\n",

      "Review 2898: It must b inside u.#asur might b confuse with name but it means evil.. a new series on #voot . As a name of the series it means how asur comes which is inside man or human. How priorties changes one for another. How ur inside asur comes ups to save ur own . Ur thought might be right for one and wrong for other.

      "Review 2902: One of the best ongoing thriller series.I have binged all the episodes of Asur It's so damn good. It's a little slow at points but gives you time to understand the story better and the Indian Mythology. So I didn't mind it. After a really long time saw a thriller hindi show, which held up till last.\n",
      "Review 2903: No doubt,this movie is a buster.These stories really fascinates anyone.We will really love the screenplay.The murders taken place in the movie are really violent and apparently they look real.There is very much intense in the movie.The actors really involved in their characters.\n",

After every episode a part of logic leaves the show and by the end you start questioning your choice. Is this show worth the hype? Answer is NO. I haven't seen so many loopholes in a single show in recent times. Comparing Asur with Family man Or Special Ops is an insult to latter ones.

Why do we value our loved ones less than we depend on them? What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.\n",
      "Review 2991: Image breaking movie for Jeet ji indeed, at this stage of his career , it's an apt film to deliver.. applause for him. Strong and stupendous performances by Jeet, Abir ,Nusrat and the entire cast & crew..a movie to remember.And ofcourse Pavel ,the new promising star director and screenwriter of our industry.. please go ahead steadily, we need good scripts and direction.\n",

      "Review 2994: #Asur so much confusing name.... The name suggests that the bad habits human have... But this single word can't describe the hardwork behind it. storyline is too good..written well and very well executed... created a so much suspense in every episode and due to this falling deeper and deeper inside it. It's a great combination of crimes and belief. Consists of most of the twist, trick, shocked and surprising movements.\n",
      "Review 2995: The actors had really put an effort to bring out the triller and suspense into an different ways. Suspense which is created by the creative team had been amazingly shown on the screen. Mystery is a basic part through which the triller is been created.

      "Review 3007: Over the past months I've realized how much improvement have Indian movies and series done in their works. However, when it comes to thrillers, I tend to be very selective and delicate because there are a lot of elements to take into consideration.Some of the actors did a pretty good job. A remarkable performance was the one from Arshad warsi and gaurav. must watch it.\n",

      "Review 3020: Povaligaaa has done a very good job once again. He reminds us about the mad artist ramkinkar bajilu, this is his best work till now. The background music was just amazing. Nickname ghosh has done really a tremendous job. I really got goose bumps foe the climax scene.totally it was a spell bound dramatic movie\n",

      "Review 3025: After binge watching all the episodes i can't wait for season 2.

I recommend others to watch this who love thrillers and also to them who doesn't because you will love it anyway.\n",
      "Review 3026: Asur',really it is a kind of masterpiece by Pavel after 'Rosogolla' . The script(though it has some flaws) keeps you engaged through out the movie.This movie is an epitome of bengali art and culture. And acting wise saying, Jeet has rediscovered himself as an actor, He reminds us about the mad artist Ramkinkar Baij, this is his best work till date, people who say he can't act should go and watch the film,And Nusrat too has given a stellar performance,and Aabir acting as a pro, not unusual for him! There were competition among these 3 that who will overshadow whom(acting wise)! And last but not the least the 'Background music', boy its just amazing, Bickram Ghosh has done an excellent job! The last seen with that BGM gave goosebumps really.\n",
      "Review 3027: Hard work on storyline and writing. Philosophy related to religion and truth presented very well. Credit goes to gaurav shukla and his team for this excellent work. Interest goes on gradually increasing.The story is unpredictable and surprising.At a timei usuallly felt that i know what will happen next but this is full of surprises. Well planned story.\n",
      "Review 3028: Something special in this movie of Asur. A different crime thriller that shows two opposing worlds against each other.Very excited to see this and after watching full episode, I realised that it was amazing one which I ever seen. Everything was fabulous and Arshad was totally involved in it.\n",
      "Review 3029: I think the performance of the actors is up to the expectations. I personally loved the part of Arshad Warsi. He has done a great job... otherwise all actors are good. Series is somehow terrifying as per the murders shown in it. I was a bit surprised from arsad warsi as i have seen him in some comedy movies and now he is totally different specially for me..\n",
      "Review 3030: Satisfactory-- story , content , act and all that. I am taking Arshad Warsi as a versatile actor after this. He is effortless. Also work of other actors Ridhi, Shrib and all is good. Its a new concept esp. in india. The work of all persons behind this series is appreciable.\n",
      "Review 3031: It was the best thriller I have watched in this segment. Every moment has new twist. And if we talk about the suspense it was Mind blowing. Eagerly waiting for second season. A little more suspense I am expecting in the next season ,full of action. And please make sure that all the characters remains the same.\n",
      "Review 3032: Scenes of autopsy are hard.. Abusive words are used but are okay and fit in act. Arshad warsi known for comedy but is also fit for a serious role like in this series.Emotions of actors are well. All actors are fit to their respective roles. Vishesh Bansal is totally admirable.Seeing him feels so good in his role.\n",
      "Review 3033: One of the best ongoing thriller series. A must watch for all\n",
      "Review 3034: One of the best show on Voot. Everyone played their character very well.

Excellent efforts by Voot producing such brilliant fictional suspence web series.I personally recomended you to watch audieance.\n",
      "Review 3035: It's a new Jeet. I guess that after this film Jeet will realise what he can do as an actor and stop doing copy movies from south. He is just too good. Nusrat is very beautiful in respect of both look and acting. Abir is in the center of the movie who controls the total script. Pavel has done a very good job once again. I think bengali mainstream cinema is going through a very positive transition period where Prasenjit, Dev, Soham, Subhashree, Shrabanti, Mimi and now Nustar and Jeet have began to reinvent themselves.\n",
      "Review 3036: This is truly the best thriller series ever been watched. Such gems shiuld truly be promoted!!Hats off..hope they release the season 2 at the earliest.. can't wait!!\n",
      "Review 3037: I have always been a fan of barun sobti, seeing him in movies is very delightful to me. Suspense, thriller movies are something that i really enjoy. I was really looking forward to it after seeing the trailer but the actual storyline is something much more than what the trailer portrays. ALL IN ALL A WONDERFUL WATCH. DONT MISS IT\n",
      "Review 3038: This was my first ever web series that i watched on internet. I was totally THRILLED after watching the series. I also recommended this to my neighbours and friends.

      "Review 3039: According to me the series is a Masterpiece. The best ever thriller for me. I can't find a single con about this series from my side. The series made me involved in it throughout the series. I am waiting for another series from the same creators.From my opinion it should be given a best series award if there is one.\n",
      "Review 3040: It is a murder mystery which unravels a hidden demon in the modern day society , who goes on rampant kiling spree in the name of religion , while a team of forensic experts struggels to solve the mystery was beyond what meets the eye. Very interesting and suspenseful series i have seen yet. I enjoyed it very much\n",
      "Review 3041: No doubt the series is amazing and creators of this series have done a great work. But the murders shown in this series are brutal. It requires a strong heart to sustain the content. I could not sleep a night after watching this. As this is a strong thriller saries it may be sustainable for someone who likes such kind of content.\n",
      "Review 3042: Marvelous script. Lots of suspense and thriller keeps you hooked up to this movie.Such a strong and competitive acting by the actors. Completely mind blowing movie. Not a very big fan of Bengali movies but this is very unique work. Asur is one of the best movies I have seen. Great work by the actors.\n",
      "Review 3043: The concepts that lay down the foundations of Asur are intriguing. We've had productions based around science, mythology, crime, etc. but not many have translated a combination of science and mythology into a story with the creative novelty that Asur has - by presenting it in the form of a crime thriller that manages to keep you on your tenterhooks at all times\n",

Really it is a worth watching this show. Waiting for its season 2 so eagerly. thank you\n",
      "Review 3045: These series have literally changed my mind and I really liked the concept of it. It is A different kind of stuff and not a rom com at all. It was something different than what I expected. In between it got a bit boring but still the end is so thrilling and it keeps you interested in it as always. Please make more series like this, it would be good for indian youth to watch such stuff\n",
      "Review 3046: Well its finally here. From the moment i saw the trailer i was waiting to watch it.Its about how your decisions and actions effect those surrounding you. Its a thought provoking story. Horror fans will love it because its something out of theroutine. Its a good watch. Unlike many horror movies that have the same storyline this is something different\n",
      "Review 3047: Asur is a mind blowing thriller. Two officers have to find the serial killer before it's too late. It's a worth watching indian series and a unique in it's kind. It's a must watch series because there is a new twist waiting for u all every 5 to 10 minutes. You'll feel thrilled while watching...... Super excited for the second season üñ§\n",
      "Review 3048: The concept is good, but the materialisation is very poor. With many loopholes, the story fails to engage the audiance. The acting of the whole crew is mediocre. A better performance is expected from Arshad Warsi.The series fails to create the thrill that it is trying to sell on.\n",

      "Review 3097: What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal. Asur is more a psychology than a thriller and a detective. How are decisions made, how do decisions affect our loved ones and the world around us? Why do we value our loved ones less than we depend on them?\n",
      "Review 3098: I absolutely love asur so much that I binge watched it in a day. Its portrayal of your psychological self is so surreal; it left me amazed. And being a psychology enthusiast I absolutely love it and recommend it to everyone. Please please watch it it's too important.\n",

      "Review 3105: Its a dark web crime series where the two opposite perceptions, way of thinking come against each other. One which stands for facts while the other believe in ancient sayings or written mythology.

      "Review 3135: There are plenty of such twists in the tale, but nothing goes as big as the benchmark set by the first twist. But they are enough to keep you riveted with where the plot is going. The makers have successfully managed to create a haunting atmosphere, aided by a sombre background score, that is ready to suck you in from the first episode itself. The show also keeps things interesting by switching between Nikhil and DJ, as to who is the main protagonist, until it is realised that both are being played upon.\n",

      "Review 3155: Asur touches upon several themes deeply rooted within Indian mythologies by delving into the different ways they can be interpreted and understood. Common perceptions of asuras (demons), devas (gods), the social structure and conflict between them, virtues and vices, justice and injustice, moral flexibilities, karma, etc. are all put under scrutiny in a way or another\n",
      "Review 3156: A good story, tells about how our own decisions affect our loved once. The way director described the two opposite characters shows his best. Barun always shows his best when comes in acting. Love this series. Completely worth watching.\n",

This is mind blowing also suspense thriller which keeps you guessing all the time that what will happen next .. Don't miss it !!\n",
      "Review 3163: The series is of about 7 episodes and is a crime and thriller based one. One of the most promising thing about this series is the acting of Arshad Warsi who plays the role of a high level CBI officer. Barun sobti( iss pyaar ko kya naam du main lead) plays the role of an ex CBI officer. The plot is basically about a serial killer who is one a ride of killing people mercilessly and it is linked to some tantrik activities in the past .To those who can watch the gruesome killing scenes again and again can go for this one but if you cannot then plz don't. All in all i will give it a 7 star!\n",
      "Review 3164: Wonderful series need more serious like this,My congratulations to you, Asur team. Your manuscript is both good and original; but the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good\n",

It didn't impress me much and yes the characters did okayish job but the series was not that great. I mean it could have been better and way more entertaining but it didn't catch that much of interest.\n",
      "Review 3168: I have watched a lot of thrillers but what i can say about this one! Yes there is thriller ...yaa it is on crime and mystery solving ...but what you see more than that is brutal killings that disgust you out. But what balances this out is the acting of the leads Arshad warsi and barun sobti.I always love to watch barun though. So those with strong hearts and time in hand give it a go\n",
      "Review 3169: FORENSIC is the gateway for everything to get confirmed that may helps the instincts to be clearified. While in the series they have been took that as a content and helped to getting know things on it\n",
      "Review 3170: I don't know is it because i love barun or what ...i loved the series! The story line is awsome as it revolves around past and present and how they are connected mysteriously.Also as soon as an indian drama adds CBI term to it ...we just get that crime scene vibes too...do watch!\n",

The show, titled Asur, arrives at a dark time with bodies still being fished out of drains in Delhi and a divided world seems to be tearing itself apart in the name of religion. The Voot Select original flirts with interesting themes -- religion and science, and where conscience and humanity fit in.\n",

      "Review 3252: A outstanding series I saw in last week. Very complex, multifaceted series.Asur is more a psychology than a thriller and a detective. How to take decision how do decisions affect our loved ones and the world around us? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.Why do we value our loved ones less than we depend on them? What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it?\n",
      "Review 3253: The show is enjoyable because of how the director incorporates it's 'oomph' factor. The best part is after every scientific revelation, the story brings in a mystic element adding to the psychological factor to the thriller. The whodunit might be easier for some to solve, but it will still keep you waiting and watching till the end.\n",
      "Review 3254: No doubt it's best ongoing series right now but The best part is how Asur uses 'karma' as a narrative device to create arcs for both its protagonists and the antagonist - what goes around comes around for them.the ending episode leaves things interesting and open-ended for the next season to arrive. I really loved it and looking for the next season.\n",

What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings?Everything is good about Asur, Be it the writing which kept me hooked and guessing till last.\n",
      "Review 3261: The concepts that lay down the foundations of Asur are intriguing.

This is something unique and different which keeps you up to watch more and more.\n",
      "Review 3262: Asur: Welcome to Your dark side is one of the examples to prove that OTT platforms contain some super contents that worth a watch.This story gives a nail biting serial killer story with a lot of Twists and plots. Most recommended for thriller genre loving people.\n",

Common perceptions of asuras (demons), devas (gods), the social structure and conflict between them, virtues and vices, justice and injustice, moral flexibilities, karma, etc. are all put under scrutiny in a way or another. A very good storyline with full of suspense and thriller.\n",

      "Review 3271: This show is a bloody masterpiece.The acting, the story, the direction, the cinematography, everything is just brilliant. Barun Sobti amazed me with his performance. He deserve many more good shows. I personally love psycho thriller shows and this just surprised me that in India we are having such talented directors and they are not getting the attention they deserve. This is beyond the Netflix content. Don't wait. Just go and watch it and I promise you that it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Looking forward for season 2üòç\n",
      "Review 3272: Eventhough you are not a crime story lover , this movie makes you as one. Barun Sobti was outstanding in this film. This is one of the very few gems of thriller stories made by OTT platforms. It is highly recommend to watch this movie if you want a full fledged entertainer.\n",

      "Review 3308: Conceptually It is the best Indian Web series yet! And also really engaging and polarising! Makes you think about the importance of existence of darkness. Definitely worth watching! And also loved the fact that they starred Arshad Warsi in it! Dude's waaaay underrated!!!\n",

      "Review 3315: Everyone has written positive . I am writing the dark side of the series:(still rated 10)1) Execution of Murders could be improved, it's not feasible that way in some cases2) Kidnapping execution is kiddish3) If you come to know someone is being blackmailed then just keep them safe4) fingerprint on notes are ignored5) no policemen have guns , cannot break the glass required at various levels6) live cast should be practically stopped7) Joining a department without BGC verification .And others are spoilers\n",

      "Review 3320: After a long time i have seen a series which is not a run of a mill kind. You will see murder happening but the reason is beyond imagination,it's a perfect crime but when you realise the reason of the serial killing it will blow your mind. The cast is good where Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti have delivered best performance, also good is the support cast like Sharib Hashmi and Riddhi Dogra. All 8 episodes will keep you engaged, i finished this series in a single watch... Without breaks... That's how good the plot is!!!\n",

      "Review 3328: Amazing and thrilling experience of asur. It lives long lasting experience of it on you. You can retrospect yourself by mythological point of view.\n",
      "Review 3329: The concept is very real and shows the actual dark side of this world. It also breaks the myth of goodness, that was never acceptable to me as well. No one including Gods are 100% perfect in this world. Everybody defines the Good or Bad as per his/her choice, there are no universal laws and even if, no one follows and violates as per need. I could never understand why Indra was always kept as King of Gods while his acts were not better than Rakshasas most of the time.\n",
      "Review 3330: This web series shows that india web is coming on it shows. Get ready to End ( beginning)\n",
      "Review 3331: Best Indian web series everWithout any boring scene and also without vulgarity this web series is must watch\n",
      "Review 3332: Asur is one of the best crime thriller series...The best part of the series is its plot which amalgamated Mythology and Forensic Science amazingly...The novel plot is a great change from the usual terrorism plot of other well known hit series...The lead characters are amazing especially Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti who played their parts very well...The complex character of the Psychopath Killer kept the suspense and thrill from the 1st till the 8th episode...The only disappointment for which it doesn't get a 10 on 10 rating is the Ending...Though this gives a hope and interest in viewers for Season 2 but personally feel as the theme of the series and the modus operandi of the killer is already known now it will not be worth watching with the same suspense it creates as Season 1...Good luck to all the Team Asur...Overall it's a superb series...Dhiraj Kaveri\n",
      "Review 3333: Definitely worth a binge watch, this one has all the ingredients to be claimed as one of the best web series to be made in India. A solid star cast with intriguing story which keeps the viewer on the edge till the end.. Looking forward for the second season..\n",
      "Review 3334: Loved it. Amazing story,cast,acting,background music ,dialogues. Perfect blend of forensic science and mythology.\n",
      "Review 3335: In absolute awe of this webseries. An astounding series that has transcended the limits of webseries' content. Even better than Sacred Games and Mirzapur but on par with The Family Man. Encountering one's dark side.... Eagerly awaiting the second season...The blend of Indian Mythology and Forensic Science is beyond amazing. And last but not the least, the unforgettable performances from Arshad Warsi, Barun Shobti and Ridhi Dogra.Highly recommended webseries...\n",
      "Review 3336: I just finished watching the series, the storyline is very confusing and the suspense is not delivered properly, it takes a lot of brain and efforts to understand who is actually Shubh and they just make the end so dissatisfying and it was too over-rated. Watch it only if you're extremely bored or have nothing else to watch. But it can a good time pass. But they tried to display the old hindu mythology holy tales in a very negative manner which may not be liked by everyone.\n",
      "Review 3337: Fantastic screen play with awesome contribution from all the actors, background score and story line especially the ground work on the crimes done by the team is very good, however the climax could be much much better, when three stalwarts were locked in a room where entire city is curious watching them, Lack of police force used in the last 15 mins was absurd and we are telling that lock of the room did not get opened with guns and heavy machinery, when a crime of that intensity is happening we usually see lot of police involving, also when the logic of killing was through the kundali, how come they killed Nikhil daughter and police officer and all the more there was no questioning of this guy(who killed police officer) when they went only two of them, obviously the questioning was not seen anywhere. Nikhil not calling any police when he escaped was foolish as there was ample time(as reflected in the timer)when he came out of that room. There were so many lose ends in the last episode and should have closed in a much better way.\n",
      "Review 3338: I watched ASUR in a single day till 3 AM Today and I would say this is something, very different content n out of the box thinking.After watching this I would say your KARMA will pay you back ... It's a combination of Hindu mythology and deep forensic.Hats off to Gaurav Shukla ... you nailed it.üëçüëç\n",
      "Review 3339: I was able to figure out the climax in the 3rd or the 4th episode. It took just the simple linking of events The overall flavor of hindu mythology and integrating it with the contemporary times , to an extent was good. But some how as the series progressed, logic took a backseat. Also the way in which CBI's utter helplessness was shown didn't go well with me. It rather turned out a one man army if you see the last episode. The ending was rather unconvincing and leaves you longing for more to get some questions answered. This surely doesn't deserve a part 2 to just unmask a culprit. It should have been done in the last episode. Overall, initially I liked the buildup but then it becomes too predictable. A class 2nd child could also predict the suspense. Just watch it for cinematography, acting of some characters and the overall hindu mythology's interpretation of asur. Nothing more! You'll come out hugely disappointed in the end. My advice would be to rather watch Special ops on Hotstar.\n",
      "Review 3340: Haven't watched full series but definitely deserve 9+ rating!\n",
      "Review 3341: Asura is well written thriller which gives its highly talented cast the impetus to move seamlessly from episode to episode. There is no sense of Deja Vu (AKA copying plot points of Hollywood ) which can be a case with Indian thrillers. The mixture of Indian mysticism and mythos and raw, infallible science and forensics is a delightful binge worthy cocktail. Add to that great perfomences from Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti (who was submerged in his role as Nikhil and was the show stealer in my opinion) . Sure, the series has some loopholes and some of the actions of characters defy logic , it is just a minor gripe in the scheme of things . Must watch if you are into thrillers like Seven ,Zodiac and the likes.\n",
      "Review 3342: All in all, wonderful work done throughout the movie : real talent and hard work does pay off and so does the sweet very sharp mind child forced to become Asur and he accepts this challenge and awes the world. Even the CBI is nothing in front of him. But all bad things end one day waiting to see the ending soon. More episode voot please launch soon,\n",
      "Review 3343: Nothing much to say, the series pretty much keeps you engaged all the time, the plot is amazing, the execution is great\n",
      "Review 3344: A really good web series with a wonderful message describing the challenges faced by a unskilled common man. Mrs Dongra has played a pioneer role in shaping the series. A must watch and a decent family web series.\n",
      "Review 3345: Gripping, keeps you lingering. Best so far in Indian web series collection.\n",
      "Review 3346: Superb series with great motivation Never Tap Out, Never Give Up\n",

      "Review 3348: Asur is Must see for anyone who understands good cinema rather than cliche movies and stories the main khan's or kapoors make\n",
      "Review 3349: Heads off to Oni Sen and the crew.Pros:Keeps you engaged till the last episode.Excellent script, direction and cast.Cons:Not much happy with end as couldn't find out the suspense and need to wait for next season so giving one star less.\n",
      "Review 3350: Unlike the other web series \"Sacred games\" this web series offers the thrilling experience from the very first episode the one who takes a bit intrest in mythological or spritual talks might feel it better the way other, moving forward to conclusion this series is worth watching, 10 times better than \"Mirzapur\". Hats off to the one and only writer Sir Gaurav Shukla and not forgetting the director the one who carved the story in the damn thrilling experience for audience Mr. Oni Sen please have a look on this series you will get to know more about your self just giving the the one star less the way it ended was a bit annoying and I thik something was missing in it so waiting for next season üòÄüòÄ.\n",
      "Review 3351: Nowadays the hindi TV series is far better than the bollywood movies. This is really a creative making.\n",
      "Review 3352: This series is one of the best series I have seen. I made this special IMDb account just to review this series <3 .I will not take much of your time, all I want to say is that this is a great series if you are into hindu mythology, battle of kurukshetra and Gita. The villan in this series is a fukin mastermind who follows teachings of Gita which makes him invincible.\n",
      "Review 3353: An unprecedented psychological thriller which makes you think over and over again even after the ending. It plays with our mind, tries to show the dark sides dwelling in us. Arshad Warsi sir hats off to you. Clearly it's not the end, kaliyug isn't gonna end so soon.\n",
      "Review 3354: Content is very violence, some dead bodies keep deep impact of viewers mind. After few episodes you will keep enjoying as screenplay justify script. Every moment of story is like magnet , you can't move away. Thrilled and Suspense in every moment. All actor did good job. Background music and pure Hindi accent with impact full dialog keep you curious. Well I like to congratulate entire team of Asur for unique content\n",

      "Review 3356: This message is to notify you that I have stumbled upon something that is truly mind-boggling , astounding & stupendous in nature . I have never ever seen a series like this in the Hindi language before . I just finished the whole series @ one go . It's fantastic & it's right up there with the best I have ever seen in any language , hope you enjoy it as I did . It has Arshad Warsi in the lead & he is staggeringly good in this one ( will make you go to the days of SEHAR) and remind you what a fantastic actor he is . Hope you will enjoy this one as much as I did. The name of the series is ASUR .P.S DONT WATCH THE TRAILER JUST WATCH IT.\n",

      "Review 3360: It is really worth watching. After watching many Hindi thriller series which were mainly based around jihad and bombing, this was a very fresh story based on Indian mythology.I will love to watch season 2 and how it shapes10/10 for fresh thriller story\n",
      "Review 3361: Story line not upto the mark. Something wrong while matching it with reality. As a CBI person could have done something to get to the real person. CBI os more of doing with instincts rather than facts, logic ans proof.\n",
      "Review 3362: What know about it it's just look simple because the cast is just simple but when u see Asur it will definitely blow ur mind that the acting the story is perfect and sometimes different has done by the maker of Asur it's just a worth watching\n",
      "Review 3363: Asur is a story of a man fighting his inner demons and troubled childhood in the garb of myth, dharma, and religion. They give him an excuse to position himself as a mythical figure in the modern era and to be a mastermind behind a series of killings in India in the name of social justice. Nikhil Nair, a former forensic officer-turned-teacher at the FBI HQ, has his heart at investigation but is forced to stick to an academic role to fulfill his familial priorities.Unexpected surprise - Asur starring Arshad Warsi & Barun Sobti The series is honestly really well written and incorporates so many elements beyond the conventional tropes of a thriller!\n",

Such raw and live content need our pure support. I will surely recommend it. Love from Europe. Amazing web series.#TeamAsur - Hard work much appreciated.\n",
      "Review 3369: Asur is easily the most well researched Web Series made in India. If not for production design and limited budget, it would had been the best web series around. This web series stands above expectation and I can bet it is going to be the best web series of 2020\n",
      "Review 3370: The series keeps you engaged till the end. Acting, Direction, Cinematography, background music is quite good. All the actors have done a great job.Although suspense is maintained till the end. They have ensured a perfect blend of mythology, forensics and how thinking of few people can impact various people around us. A great deal of reference is given to the stories from purana and veda which turns out to be the essence of all the actions performed in the series.Overall it is quite refreshing and gripping for the ones who loves thrillers with a blend of mythology and science. 5/5\n",

      "Review 3460: Amazingly, the logics are explained through mythology and may seem absurd to some of us. In the end, it may ask you - which side are you on? Arshad Warsi and Sharif Hashmi are at their best.\n",
      "Review 3461: I'm giving 7/10 because of 4 reasons1. Script's- Concept & Ideology quite around JOKER.2. Can be completed in 5 episodes3. Negative lead should be more powerful & impacting4. It doesn't give that mental impact after watching, that you ask yourself; what is my Dark Side?Correct me if I'm wrong üòä\n",

The story, screenplay, writing, dialogues, acting and cinematography are just top notch.The best part of this series is to use the dark side of Hindu Mythology to bring out asur from each character in the series.

It felt rushed many times as characters were just moving from one location to another very quickly, removing any sense of reality. There were actions taken by good guys that they shouldn't have been able to get away. The bad guys, who were shown to have great number of followers in the first season, just vanished in the second without any proper explanation.It gets annoying by each episode. Not gonna watch 2nd season üòÖüòÖ\n",

      "Review 3741: Whole series is full of sensation and mysterious incidents. Filled with excellent acting whole act is designed with very excellence.\n",
      "Review 3742: The series had a good start and first 3-4 episodes build interest for more what follows a typical Indian series disappointment. Too many cliches, pot holes in the story without being logical. Anyway Logic and Bollywood doesn't go hand in hand but had really high expectation after initial episodes.The final episode was the worst with revelation that too many antagonists plotting murders and a kind of religious sects are killing people.I am giving it 2 out of sheer disappointment on what could this story would have been if logic had prevailed.\n",
      "Review 3743: It could have been much better if too many mistakes avoided\n",
      "Review 3744: Had high hopes after the trailer but the actual deal was pretty pathetic. From FX to acting, logic to plot, everything was off. Series like Mind Hunter, True Detective and many more has set the bar way higher. And Asur being from thriller and crime genre did not meet the expected bars.Sorry to say, but \"no point using intelligence to ruin a brainless movie\" or series in this case.\n",
      "Review 3745: This show really hold me till 7th episode but when it comes to climax it was a disaster.\n",

      "Review 3751: There are a few loopholes in the series but overall writing is top notch. All the actors did a fabulous job. Nikhil's breakdown scene in captivity....wow barun sobti can act. It was amazing seeing arshad warsi play a serious role. Patiently waiting for season 2\n",

      "Review 3756: Never thought that indian cinema can make a series of this level hat's off to all the creators and actors.\n",
      "Review 3757: Well written with good depth in story few tweaks here en there but minor ones though, if were refined would have made this series far more awesome. But still it's really a very good tv series to binge on. It's a thriller with mythology element in it. It's the best thriller series, I have seen in recent times. Really loved it. Giving it 10 stars so that to encourage the team so that more people watch it which eventually might lead to a similar or far more awesome season 2 experience üòä\n",
      "Review 3758: The web series is the best mythological web series and it is also one of the top web series in India, I am sure If this voice had come with English dubbing then it could have left a great following across the world.Not talking about the story, watch it yourself, the story is made with a mythological history in the background, the actual mystery is not shown yet, maybe it will be revealed in season 2.The entire CBI team is unable to stop the ongoing serial killing cases despite their best efforts. Every episode features a new modder and that too with different mechanisms.Overall I really like the webseries and can't wait for season 2.\n",
      "Review 3759: Currently Mindblown watching the brilliant web-series 'ASUR'.This show is an example of a research well done and a time spent well knowing our scriptures ! A take on evil and good that co-exists ! Kalyug ka varnan bade achese kiya hai!Every element in the show is perfect be it its Actors selection, dialogues, script, direction ! Sab kuch behadh sundar.Lovely comeback for Arshad warsi, great acting as always Amey Wagh. Barun Sobti, wonderful comic timing Sharib Hashmi and few others!A Must watch. What more than educating ourselves with some ancient mythology in times of lockdown.10/10 !Hats off to the writers, direction team and all the essential elements of this masterpieceGreat job Vibhu Kashyap !\n",
      "Review 3760: The storyline is much appreciated in view of its actual consciousness about the subconscious human mind. It has certainly ignited my mind about guilt of karma and it's dominance over personal life events. The case studies convincingly show how even the learned forensic scientists couldn't hide their guilt. However, reason for Sobti's call to choose his daughter over hostages wasn't convincing. It would've been more logical if his love for Nusrat highlighted for this.Overall a good show that shouldn't be missed.\n",
      "Review 3761: Eagerly waiting for season two...just extremely impressed with the season 1...thanks to the makers of the series...want more like this in India...Peace.\n",
      "Review 3762: Just one word masterpiece story screenplay direction acting just amazing despirately waiting for the season 2\n",

      "Review 3764: I liked the entire show.. and i was afraid that it's end ll be filmy where hero wins.. but thanks to god that end was realistic.. achhai aur burai kabhi khtam nhi hoti.. they just go parallel to each other\n",
      "Review 3765: I saw this series after hearing about the hype and the 8.5 imdb rating but the show started with a decent plot and then stretched over 8 episodes to fall down badly. It definitely doesn't deliver on the setup and the second half of the series feels just gimmicky and a bit over the top.If you have free time and want to see a Hindi TV series, you can watch it if you are running out of other options.I give it a 6 at best for its overall execution.\n",
      "Review 3766: Powerful scripting, tight performance and enough mystery to sail through the entire 8 episodes. Leaves us wanting for more. Kudos to team asur\n",
      "Review 3767: I say this proudly that this web series is made in india by Indians..the best web series till date in india ..it's just fantabulous\n",

U need good quality of understanding , dumb people will say it's useless but it shows the reality that evil exist in everyone of us no one is good what is the context of asur ,well explained and yes it's the one of the web series which shows a great gesture of Hinduism context really a masterpiece a best one I have watched till now ....\n",
      "Review 3772: What started as a promising , Intriguing and captivating story ,ended as a lame story with no logic at all & loopholes as big as the great canyon. Sheer disappointment and waste of time . 6 starts just for the sake of thinking out of blue and trying to make something different & for Arshad's acting but I guess no thought process was given to implementation part.\n",

      "Review 3778: Superb suspenseful tv show, amazing storyline, superb acting, all characters play superb role\n",
      "Review 3779: In terms of performance, Asur cannot be described in a single word. Simple single gaze, yet extremely deep emotions presented so effortlessly. Intelligent forensic specialist to family guy, a kind father and husband to a Scary Asur with whom he battles emotions. This was an incredible tension thriller. The writing keeps you interested throughout the film. One thing I absolutely appreciated was the background music, which was simply beautiful; Bickram Ghosh did an incredible job! The closing scene with that BGM gave me chills. I recently completed watching Asur. The study done on mythology, astrology, science, and psychology, as well as how effectively it has all been interconnected to produce and execute this masterpiece, is incredible - kudos to the whole team, actors, and crew! I enjoyed every minute of it!\n",
      "Review 3780: If u love to watch a good plot then this is for u best acting .U can't stop yourself to watch 2 nd ep if u watched 1st ...u can't get bore.\n",
      "Review 3781: After watching the show, I can state with some certainty that it is top-notch and world-class. It must be exposed to the entire world and not only to Indian viewers. Gaurav Shukla and his writers did an excellent job. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H Bhatt. Suspense is abundant in this series. Every minute and second, you wonder what will happen next. Excellent introduction to such a Psycho personality. This series piqued my interest from the beginning. It is incredibly mind-blowing, and the premise of the story is both exciting and puzzling, making the web series even more intriguing. I always promote this extremely wonderful online series to my friends, and I also enjoy viewing it.\n",

I credit it to direction that it kept me binded to the storyline. More so story gives you insight on something which compelled me to think about Asur in everyone..\n",
      "Review 3791: The simple Answer is I am waiting for season 2. The screen play is awesome. The actors performance is very commendable.\n",
      "Review 3792: Asur looked realistic mostly forensic scenes were apt. Each and every character did their great job whoever it was Barun or Arshad or Ridhi especially Arshad and his intense character. Asur is more about psycological than thriller. This series will simply blow your mind.\n",
      "Review 3793: It is a masterpiece web serie must watch. Just I am waiting for season 2 , I promise u it will not bore u must watch. Don't think anything just go and the asur series.\n",
      "Review 3794: You have hit the target on the head, Mr. Warsi. It is a fantastic story that is also expertly directed. Congratulations to all of the characters, who all performed admirably. Asur, the finest Hindi web series in terms of science and Hindu philosophy, recently concluded. I'm looking forwards to the second installment. Outstanding effort, gentleman. This year, Asur will obtain every prise. This web series receives a perfect score due to its excellent acting, direction, and storyline. What did I just say... Guess what they did over the weekend? I'm not over it yet... What precisely is Kali's identity? When will this be over? Intelligent writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the time required by artists and publishers is not excessive.\n",
      "Review 3795: Whole concept is very different and interesting. It's a must watch series.. Eagerly waiting for the next season. I love the fact that it could be seen with family as well doesn't like few other crime thriller drama.\n",
      "Review 3796: ASUR 2 is one of the best series I have seen when we talk about Indian series...season 2 has set bar high for themselves...the story execution and 100% from the actors is best you can watch. Awaiting for season 3 to drive us all crazyASUR 2 is one of the best series I have seen when we talk about Indian series...season 2 has set bar high for themselves...the story execution and 100% from the actors is best you can watch.ASUR 2 is one of the best series I have seen when we talk about Indian series...season 2 has set bar high for themselves...the story execution and 100% from the actors is best you can watch.\n",
      "Review 3797: Asur 2 is a pack of mythological , suspense thriller webseries. You can't predict the original plot till the very end. That's the speciality of this webseries.Acting wise this is totally top notch. Especially Arshad Warsi at his best and none the less Barun sobti and Vishesh Bansal ( Young Shubh Joshi ) acting were just mesmerizing. Editing is the only thing , I think does not meet the high standards compare to other thing. If you see the scene of DJ and Naina torturing Swati carefully then you can see the urgency in editing. Last two episodes were action packed. If you are watching this review then I strongly recommend you to watch this series, trust me this is worth to watch.\n",
      "Review 3798: You made a good argument, Arshad Warsi. It has an excellent plot and is beautifully handled. All of the actors should be praised for their outstanding performances. Asur, the most scientifically and Hinduly focused Hindi web series, has been completed. I'm looking forwards to the next installment. Dude, you did an excellent job. This year, Asur will take home every prise. This online series has the finest acting, direction, and plot that I have ever seen. What was I talking about earlier... I'll watch it after all of the episodes have been released, and you can probably guess what they did over the weekend. I still haven't recovered... So, who exactly is Kali? When will this be over? A well-written story will keep you guessing about what will happen next. All I can say is that I hope it doesn't take too long for writers and publishers.\n",
      "Review 3799: Everyone who contributed to it aspired for it to be truly remarkable. We owe a debt of gratitude to Gaurav Shukla for his insightful and well-written piece. I'd want to express my gratitude to Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the fantastic crew. My next assignment is still pending. The idea is lovely. I was happy to finally see Arsad Warsi in a movie after what seemed like an eternity. It's unbelievable that two universes can work together to defeat evil. The trailer didn't even need to be made for me to want to see this film. The story of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, forensics professionals on the trail of a serial murderer, is told in Asur, which is more than simply another crime thriller. It forces us to examine our moral compass and the weight of our decisions in times of crisis.\n",
      "Review 3800: The second season of Asur exemplifies the craft of suspense at its finest. Although all of the performers are terrific, Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti stand out. The plot moves quickly and is really interesting, keeping you guessing until the finish. The show skilfully blends scientific fact and myth. The author's use of ancient writings like the Vedas to better understand the serial killer's psyche is interesting and scary. The show also considers the dark side of artificial intelligence. Below, we'll talk about the good and bad points of the series. The film's strengths lie in the fact that it \"combines folklore with modern technologies\" and has \"excellent acting.\" Weaknesses include: *Poor VFX *Some bumps in the tale.\n",
      "Review 3801: This is without a doubt my favourite Bollywood film. I love SOBTI BARUN, and I can't wait for season two since it's the best thing Arshad Warsi has ever created. I haven't been this impressed with an internet series in a long time, and this one has definitely made me want to check out some more Bollywood productions. Even though I usually like American television, this has peaked my curiosity in exploring Bollywood's offerings. I'm tempted to offer you a spoiler, but I won't, since you should watch it because it's art. This is more than simply an exciting book; it's a riveting play. It's a game of mental tease. Near the middle of the series, the plot thickens and reaches a climax that leaves you wanting more. The word \"psychological thriller\" is well used to describe this episode.\n",
      "Review 3802: The best web series, if you are into Dark and Crime genre and it's mythological references are the cherries on the cake. It combines mythology with modern AI and the way they did it , freakingamazing. Absolutely Loveeed it. Everyone's acting was on point, even the side characters were great. After a great 1st season and a 3 year long time, they have created a masterpiece. It was worth the wait. And there is a third season coming as well, so it's not end. There is again a last scene suspicious scene which hints us that there will be a 3rd season. Very excited for it, hopefully they don't take much time for season 3 .\n",
      "Review 3803: Despite having more than 8 rating, disappoints on multiple levels. Asur attempts to recreate the suspense and thrill of renowned international series like Prison Break and 24 within an Indian context. The show heavily relies on the borrowed concepts and characters, While it may intrigue viewers some entertainment, The show lacks originality, relying heavily on Western influences and storylines. The plot feels recycled. The same old stupid drama, stupid scenes. Just added some Indian mythological concepts and dialogues.Familiarity Overshadows. Asur attempts to present an old dish in a new plate.\n",
      "Review 3804: A few episodes, I can say without reservation that it's fantastic. It should be seen by people all throughout the world, not only in India. The writing by Gaurav Shukla and his colleagues is excellent. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt authored this book. The stakes are really high in this series. Your mind is always racing with anxious thoughts about the future. The stage is well prepared for the crazy character. I was immediately intrigued by the show's trailer. The web series is great, and the premise of the story is thrilling and engaging, so I've been watching every episode. I have recommended this online series to several others, and they are all hooked.\n",
      "Review 3805: Every episode of Asur 2 reveals new secrets, making it the ideal mythological thriller. It's the same gang of bad guys that always manages to scam Dhanjay Rajpoot and his crew. Arshad Warsi did a great job portraying the well-written role. Varun Arora and Amey wagh are in the same boat. The foundation of the programme (using AI to anticipate and analyse user activity) and the incorporation of a legendary theme are a perfect fit for the show's narrative. Other Starcast members have also done a great job, however the story drags on until episode 8 because of unnecessary, extended passages. If the episodes had been more tightly edited, the show may have ended after six seasons. Fun aside, the programme will only be around 30 minutes long, and it will consist of her enacting algorithms created by geeks for geeks.\n",
      "Review 3806: Clearly, a great deal of effort went into creating this web series. The story is compelling on multiple levels. The skill of the show's writers is evident in the vivid depictions of the characters and the consistency of the narrative from episode to episode. Through its depiction of modern conflict's lethal consequences, the series serves as a sobering reminder of the scope of its ramifications. The film industry could use more web series with such an intricate plot. Therefore, I implore the show's producers to expedite Season 3 production. The mesmerising performance of Arshad Warsi as the protagonist enhances an already excellent plot. 27 You are ahenlutely correct Mr. Warci.\n",
      "Review 3807: Alternatively, the performers, the filmmaker, and the score. Definitely something you should see. We can't wait for Season 2! After watching the full season, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language about this programme. Having seen the performance, I can declare with some certainty that it is of the greatest level and calibre. SPELLBINDING INTRIGUING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING. It has to be shown all throughout the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, the founder and author, has accomplished a great deal. Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh, under the able direction of Oni Sen Arshad Warsi, did outstanding work, as did Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. If you see the programme, it will leave an indelible mark on your mind. The show's second season has my full attention.\n",
      "Review 3808: The plot, acting, narrating, graphics, and sound design all combine to make this an incredible show. Best performances have been delivered by Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Rishad Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, and Pawan Chopra. This show deserves the prise, and it will get it. It's the kind of show that makes you wonder if the things you take for granted about right and wrong are, in fact, correct. This series has made extraordinary efforts to blend futuristic elements with mythological ones. Strongly suggested...check it out, and by all means, look up to season three with great anticipation. This mind-blowing suspense thriller will have you guessing until the very end. The preview does not do the film credit. It has everything: mythology, psychology, forensics, great score, and a well-thought-out plot. Assertively recommended.\n",
      "Review 3809: This web series is so well made that it immediately grabs viewers' attention and pulls them into the complex storyline. The excellent continuity from episode to episode and the multidimensional characters showcase the series' exceptional narrative. The series serves as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of contemporary warfare by depicting its lethal repercussions. The film industry should produce more shows of this calibre for the internet. So, please, I beg you, Season 3 of this show as soon as humanly feasible. The series has a fascinating protagonist thanks to Arshad Warsi's hypnotic acting, and the dialogue is also top-notch.\n",
      "Review 3810: In the moment where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing a person, there is a mistake in the editing. Asur is flawless in every way, but especially in its writing, which left me guessing right up until the very end. I'm caught up on Asur and have seen every episode. The flavour is out of this world. Slow in spots, but worth it for the deeper dive into Indian mythology and tale it affords you. So, I didn't find it very annoying. I finally got around to seeing an urdu thriller after a lengthy hiatus, and it was well worth the wait. This time, Arshad Warsi joins Asur in front of the cameras and his fans on the digital screen. Outstanding screenplay and direction, beautifully realised. All of the actors are perfectly in sync with one other. Each everyone there gave their all to make it a night to remember. Thank you so much to Gaurav Shukla, who did a fantastic job penning this. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the crew also deserve credit for their great efforts. The next task is currently pending.\n",
      "Review 3811: Because I watched it, I can say with sure that the performance is of the highest quality and grade. It must be presented all across the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, the company's creator and author, has done a lot. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal wrote this piece. This series has unrivalled suspense. You're always wondering what will happen in the next minute. A fantastic framework for comprehending the Psycho persona. I knew this series was for me the moment I saw it. The online series is even more interesting because of the plot's mind-boggling concept. This online curriculum is wonderful, and I frequently suggest it to my friends.\n",
      "Review 3812: I used to think that the first seasons of Sacred Games on Netflix and Breathe on Amazon were the greatest Indian web series accessible. However, after seeing ASUR, my perspective has radically changed; I now consider it the finest Indian web series ever made. Because it is founded on reality and seriousness, it is horrifying; it is deserving of the term \"The Best.\" You will not be able to turn away. Neither Voot Select nor this web series have gained a lot of publicity. But believe me when I tell that this show is a rare find on Indian television and online. I've never been so enthusiastic about a film or web series before. It's encouraging to see an increase in production qualities in Bollywood and other Indian television shows. Talented performers have always been a part of our industry, but in recent years, directors have begun to prioritise plot. Our writing is improving as well. Fortunately, it's only a superlative....\n",
      "Review 3813: I can state with some certainty that the performance is of the greatest quality and grade because I saw it. It has to be shown all throughout the world, not only in India. Gaurav Shukla, the founder and author, has accomplished a great deal. This work was written by Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. The suspense in this series is unparalleled. You keep wondering what's going to happen in the following minute. A superb framework within which to understand the Psycho character. When I first saw this series, I knew it was for me. The web series is even more compelling because of how mind-boggling the idea of the plot is. This online series is really fantastic, and I love recommending it to my friends.\n",
      "Review 3814: How vulnerable are we to individuals who, on the surface, seem kind and rational but who, in reality, have their own agenda, power over you, and are ready to influence your ideas and minds in today's high-tech, scientific world where we're getting more alienated and lonely? There are a few tense action scenes involving life and death that add an exotic element to the film. The action unfolds in a succession of linked scenes, with the hero at the heart, and finds itself located in foreign places where the hero must execute body searches. Outstanding in both form and function! A must-watch for suspense buffs! After watching the full season, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language about this programme. STUNNING BREATHTAKING MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC.\n",
      "Review 3815: Asur Season 2 is a professionally produced and tense drama. The performances of Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti stand out. The story moves quickly and effectively keeps the reader guessing until the end. The series manages to blend mythology and science fiction seamlessly. It is very interesting and disturbing that the killer's intentions are explained by references to the Vedas and other ancient books. The dangers of AI are also explored, as is the potential for evil AI to bring about...Here are some of the series' pros and cons: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are lackluster. Several plot flaws.\n",
      "Review 3816: Asur's performance is too complex to be summed up in a single word. Expressing complex feelings with only a look is second nature to certain people. Intelligent forensic specialist turned family guy, now struggling emotionally with his Fearsome Asur wife and their two young children. This page-turner of a thriller left me reeling. The script keeps things interesting all the way through. The score, composed and performed superbly by Bickram Ghosh, was one of my favourite parts of the whole experience. The last scene with this background music gave me the goosebumps. Finished watching Asur just now. Mythology, astrology, physics, and psychology all play crucial roles in the development and presentation of this masterwork; congratulations to all involved! I soaked in every word!\n",
      "Review 3817: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything in Asur is excellent, but the writing kept me puzzled and captivated until the very end. I have watched each episode of Asur. It is very impressive. It occasionally proceeds slowly, but this helps the reader comprehend the plot and Indian mythology. So I had no objections. After a lengthy absence, I watched an Urdu suspense that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears alongside Asur on a digital projection for the audience and his followers. The script and execution of this film are outstanding. Each performer has flawless action synchronisation. Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment.\n",
      "Review 3818: You have hit the target on the head, Mr. Warsi. It is a fantastic story that is also expertly directed. Congratulations to all of the characters, who all performed admirably. Asur, the finest Hindi web series in terms of science and Hindu philosophy, recently concluded. I'm looking forwards to the second installment. Outstanding effort, gentleman. This year, Asur will obtain every prise. This web series receives a perfect score due to its excellent acting, direction, and storyline. What did I just say... Guess what they did over the weekend? I'm not over it yet... What precisely is Kali's identity? When will this be over? Intelligent writing will leave you wondering what will occur next. I can only trust that the time required by artists and publishers is not excessive.\n",
      "Review 3819: This will be only confusing for those who has lower IQ and not so well educated in terms of science and Indian Mythology as well.All the lead characters are chosen perfectly and they did their job very honestly.It's a must watch web series even if you're not a Web series lover. Arshad Warsi has proved that he is not only a comic actor but also a versatile actor in all the dimensions. The production team did it all well in case of research and execution.Maybe this is a fictional story but it's relatable in real life.If you summarise my opinion, it is a great web series for 16+ audience especially for literate people who are connected to their roots.\n",
      "Review 3820: An exceptional thriller never before in Bollywood or Hollywood some has captured essence of struggle between good and bad with such real world scenario ..the connect to most powerful and most ancient Hindu mythology is just mind blowing ..it just not a superb thriller it raises very true questions about the world we live in and also gives you answers on occasions . I have never seen a series with such an powerful impact . The acting skills are over the top the setups are real shooting done on real locations no overthe top CGI what a work of genius it is .kudos to writers and story designers ..just mind blowing.\n",
      "Review 3821: The absence of profanity and profane language distinguishes this series. The entire household may participate in the amusement. Set aside seven to eight hours to view this series, as you will not be disappointed. The acting and cinematography are both of the highestcalibre. The series as a whole is flawless; there is not a single fault. Asur deserves the excellent ratings he has received. There is not a single flaw here. I've developed an Asur hangover. The beginning and ending music isquite ominous. It continues to play in my head. Honestly, it rates among the finest concerts I've ever witnessed. I adored every aspect, including the script, direction, and performances. I completed Asur in a single session. This is the first time I have ever watched an entire Web series in one sitting. Finally, an intelligent programme that can compete with Westerners. Please accept my gratitude for presenting us with such an excellent performance.\n",
      "Review 3822: Completely accurate, Arshad Warsi. It has an excellent narrative and is masterfully executed. Everyone in the ensemble did an outstanding job with their assigned duties. Asur, the best online Hindi series, combines scientific and Hindu philosophical concepts in an effective manner. I cannot wait for the next installment, which I adored. This year, Asur will receive every conceivable honour. A web series with the best acting, the best direction, and the best narrative merits a perfect score of 10 out of 10. I cannot fathom what I have just completed. I'll give it a try on the weekend, when all the episodes are available, which is opportune because that's when it was produced. The astonishment has not yet worn off... Describe what or who Kali is. How long will it continue? Well-written works maintain suspense until the final page. We can only hope that the production and publication procedures do not take too long.\n",
      "Review 3823: This web series has been meticulously produced, and it shows. Each of the story's multiple aspects is compelling. The exceptional character portrayals and episode-to-episode consistency of the narrative demonstrate the series' storytelling prowess. By depicting the lethal effects of modern warfare, the series serves as a sobering reminder of its far-reaching ramifications. The film industry must create more web series with such meticulous structure. Therefore, I implore the producers of the programme to expeditiously create Season 3. The dialogue is outstanding, and Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance as the main character elevates the series.\n",
      "Review 3824: Asur's performance defies succinct description. Expressing complex feelings in a simple way is surprisingly easy. Intelligent forensics expert turned family guy, now married to a ferocious Asur with whom he has a rocky emotional relationship despite their shared intelligence. Incredible tension filled this novel. The script does a great job of keeping your attention throughout the whole movie. I thought Bickram Ghosh did a fantastic job with the score. The score to the last scene was chilling. I have recently completed seeing Asur. Congratulations to the whole team, actors, and crew on this masterwork, which incorporates mythology, astrology, science, and psychological study so brilliantly. Thanks for all the feedback!\n",
      "Review 3825: The latest series on #voot is called \"asur,\" which means \"evil,\" alluding to the fact that this evil originates from within each individual. What happens when one value replaces another. The role that your natural wrath plays in keeping you alive. Your viewpoint might be spot-on, but others could disagree. An really dark tale. Each of the eight episodes draws the viewer deeper into the story. The directing, acting, and script will leave you stunned. The team's combined efforts are incredible. Must abide with the rules. In only three words: holy s***! Wow, that's quite a sum! Wow, what a start for Select balloting! Never before have I witnessed an Indian show like this. The writing, directing, and acting are all top-notch. It's a fantastic blend of detective fiction and mythology.\n",
      "Review 3826: This web series is so well made that it quickly draws the viewer into the intricate plot. The ability to seamlessly link episodes and properly characterise various characters is evidence of the series' tremendous narrative talent. The series serves as a depressing reminder of the ubiquitous impact of contemporary warfare by illustrating its devastating impacts. The film business needs to make more web shows like this. So, please consider my request for Season 3 to begin production as soon as possible. Arshad Warsi's magnetic performance as the protagonist gives the show a mysterious air, and the writing and acting are both top-notch.\n",
      "Review 3827: What a phenomenal mind-blowing web series! I'm in awe of anant acting, who plays the character of Deva, and it's worthy acting of arshad Warshi, who plays the best role. All the actors have done great acting, and Asur 2 has garnered millions of views, making it the first criminal webseries. Giving 10/10 and one request to the director please release Asur parts 3 and 4 as soon as possible. You should watch this webseries because you'll always be surprised like what they will do next . For example, in the final episode, when Shubh was doing a sonic attack, you might have thought, \"I wish I could do something.\" This suggests that you are constantly considering what you should do next.\n",
      "Review 3828: Asur's performance cannot be summarised in a single word. Simple, single-gaze expression of profoundly profound emotions. Intelligent forensic specialist to family man, kind father and spouse to a frightening Asur with whom he struggles emotionally. This was an exceptional tension-filled thriller. The writing keeps you engaged throughout the duration of the film. BickramGhosh performed an exceptional job with the background music, which I found to be exquisite. The final scene's background music gave me shivers. I just finished viewing Asur. The research on mythology, astrology, science, and psychology, as well as how effectively it has all been integrated into the production and execution of this masterpiece, is astounding - congratulations to the entire team, cast, and personnel! I loved every second of it!\n",
      "Review 3829: And are we, in this high-tech, scientific world where we're getting more alienated and lonely, more likely to fall prey to those who look friendly and logical but are, in reality, following their own agenda, exercising control over you, and trying to influence your ideas and minds? There are a few high-stakes action scenes that create an uncommon sense of tension for the audience. The plot unfolds in a succession of exciting scenes in which the protagonist plays a central role and performs body searches in far-flung locations that are so magnificent that they keep the audience on the edge of their seats until the very end. The composition and performance are both superb. Fans of suspenseful films should not miss this. After viewing the whole season, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language about this programme. Incredible, unbelievable, mind-blowing, fascinating, and thought-provoking.\n",
      "Review 3830: Season 2 of Asur is a well-made and dramatic drama. Both Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti deliver exceptional performances. The narrative proceeds swiftly and maintains suspense until the conclusion. The series combines mythology and technology seamlessly. The use of the Vedas and other ancient texts to explain the killer's motives is both intriguing and disquieting. The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil...Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are subpar. Several plot flaws.\n",
      "Review 3831: This is one of the best Bollywood films I've ever seen. Arshad Warsi's performance in BARUN SOBTI is the best I've ever seen, and I eagerly anticipate the second season. I haven't seen a better online series in quite some time. I enjoy watching Hollywood web series, but this has piqued my curiosity about Bollywood content. I hope the second season surpasses the first. This article contains no spoilers, but I am compelled to reveal one. However, I will not because the film is an artistic creation. This series is more than just a suspense. It stimulates mental activity. The story advances effectively, and the conclusion leaves you wanting more! This programme is a \"psychological thriller\" in the finest sense of the term.\n",
      "Review 3832: When it comes to summing up Asur's efficacy, it's impossible to do so briefly. One look was all it took, yet the depth of feeling it transmitted was extraordinary. A great expert in forensics by day, by night he is a devoted husband and father to his Scary Asur wife. What an incredible page-turner! The script keeps things interesting all the way through. One of the things I liked best was the soundtrack, which was composed by Bickram Ghosh and was excellent. The music in the final titles gave me shivers. I just finished watching Asur. It's astounding how the writers, directors, performers, and technicians all worked together to include so many different fields of study into the making of this masterpiece. It was quite entertaining to me.\n",
      "Review 3833: Everyone who worked on it aimed to make it exceptional. For his thoughtful and well-written post, we must thank Gaurav Shukla. To Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the amazing team: thank you. I'm waiting for my next task. The concept is beautiful. After what felt like forever, I was relieved to see Arsad Warsi in a film again. It's astonishing that a plan involving two parallel universes against evil can succeed. I was already interested in seeing this movie before I ever watched the trailer. Asur is more than just another crime thriller about forensics experts Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti on the trail of a serial killer. It compels us to question our guiding principles and the bearing of our choices under extreme stress.\n",
      "Review 3834: Asur's second season is a masterclass in the art of suspense. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti give particularly impressive performances, although all of the actors are excellent. The story is fast-paced and intriguing, keeping the reader guessing until the very end. The programme deftly mashes together scientific fact and ancient legend. The author's reliance on the Vedas and other ancient texts to illuminate the serial killer's mind is both fascinating and unsettling. The series also explores the potential for AI to be used for evil. Both the series' strengths and weaknesses are discussed below. Strengths: *Excellent acting* *A taut, suspenseful, and thought-provoking plot* *combines folklore with modern technologies. Weaknesses: *Poor visual effects (VFX) *There are a few kinks in the story.\n",
      "Review 3835: In my opinion, among the finest Bollywood movies ever made. Incredible performance by one of my fave actors, Arshad Warsi, makes me eager for season two of SOBTI BARUN. I've been waiting for a web series like this, and it hasn't disappointed. I can't wait to watch more Bollywood movies and shows now. My interest in Bollywood has been piqued; I typically watch American TV. I'm tempted to give away a spoiler but will stop since you should see it because it's art. This is much more than just an exciting read. This is an exercise in mental stimulation. Around the halfway point of the series, the plot really starts to thicken up and you reach your peak of interest. You may characterise this show as a \"psychological thriller\" because that's what it is.\n",
      "Review 3836: After seeing the programme, I can say with confidence that it is excellent and ranks high among the greatest in the world. The film should be shown to people all throughout the world, not only in India. Both the creator and the author, Gaurav Shukla, deserve praise for their outstanding work. Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. Series of Extremely Exciting Adventures. You can't help but speculate about the future at every waking minute. The protagonist, Psycho, was presented convincingly. When I first saw this series, I knew I had to read it. Amazing work, with a notion that is both engaging and puzzling enough to make for a great web series. I've been raving about this online series to anybody who would listen.\n",
      "Review 3837: The show is fantastic because to its excellent cast, script, structure, visuals, soundtrack, and story. Whether it's Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Anupriya Goenka, Abhishek Chauhan, Ridhi Dogra, Meiyang Chang, Amey Wagh, or Pawan Chopra, every single one of them has been phenomenal. This show will undoubtedly win the award. A show like this might make you question your assumptions. When it comes to mixing mythology with technology, this series has dug deep. I can't recommend it highly enough; you should read it. A mind-blowing suspense novel that will keep you guessing right up to the final page. The trailer does the film no justice. The film has everything: mythology, psychology, forensics, an outstanding music, and a well-planned storyline. You shouldn't let this opportunity pass you by.\n",
      "Review 3838: Don't be fooled by the title; \"asur\" means \"evil\" in Arabic, and the series' title alludes to the psychological roots of evil. Priorities rise and fall with time. How far your inner asur will go to guard your safety. Your perspective may be right for you but wrong for others. A terrifying story that is expertly crafted. There are a total of eight episodes, and they gradually increase in intrigue. I was blown away by the entire production, from the writing to the performances. The collective effort is incredible. Not to be missed. Holy cow!! Is sufficient in itself. It's quite a string of events, huh? This is a fantastic first step for Voot choose. The United States has never before shown an Indian television show like this. Everything about it was excellent; the writing, the direction, the performances. It's the perfect combination of intrigue and myth.\n",
      "Review 3839: Or the Artists (Score, Directors, Actors). This is absolutely worth your time. Waiting hopefully for season two. Now that I've seen the full season, I can confidently describe this show. The concert was really wonderful; after seeing it, I felt confident in saying that it was one of the finest in the world. The film should be shown to people all throughout the world, not only in India. Both the creator and the author, Gaurav Shukla, deserve praise for their outstanding work. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey wagh gave great performances in this work by Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal, capably directed by Oni Sen. If you manage to see the concert, it will forever stick in your mind. Season 2 has my undivided attention.\n",
      "Review 3840: The scene in which Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are torturing another character contains an editing error. Asur is superb in every way; the writing alone had me guessing till the very end. I binge-watched the whole first season of Asur. Wow, that's awesome. Slower than average pace allows for deeper immersion in the story's Indian mythology and culture. That's why I didn't mind at all. I was relieved to see a hindi thriller that had my attention right up to the final scene. Fans of Arshad Warsi will be pleased to see him rejoin with Asur on film. This picture has an excellent story and direction. Everyone on stage has perfect timing. Everyone who worked on it aimed to make it exceptional. For his thoughtful and well-written post, we must thank Gaurav Shukla. To Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the rest of the amazing team: thank you. I'm waiting for my next task.\n",

Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment. The concept is extremely beautiful. It was great to see Arsad Warsi on television again after so long. Incredible is the concept of two universes and their struggle against evil. I chose to watch the movie despite not having seen the trailer. Asur is more than a straightforward crime thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a cat-and-mouse game in quest of the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur. It causes us to doubt our morals, beliefs, and values at various junctures, as well as the decisions we make in extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 3842: After observing the performance, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the highest calibre and quality. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. Suspense prevails throughout the series. You agonise about the future every minute and second. Excellent summary of the Psycho character. I was instantly drawn to this series upon my initial exposure to it. It's truly mind-boggling, and the story's premise is both intriguing and perplexing, which adds to the web series' intrigue. I frequently recommend this excellent online series to my peers, and also enjoy viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 3843: The performance of Asur cannot be summarised in a single phrase. It is easy to communicate profound emotions with a single, straightforward expression. Intelligent forensics expert turned family man, devoted father, and emotionally conflicted spouse. This was a fantastic novel of suspense. The plot holds your interest throughout the duration of the film. I appreciated the excellent work that Bickram Ghosh did with the background music. I experienced shivers during the final scene's BGM. Have just completed watching Asur. It is astounding how gorgeously mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research have been woven into the conception and implementation of this masterpiece; congratulations to the entire team, actors, and staff! Enjoyed each syllable!\n",
      "Review 3844: As the title of a new #voot series, theterm asur, which means \"evil,\" refers to the origin of asur within the human body. The manner in which one priority replaces another. The manner in which your inner fury saves your life. Your viewpoint may be correct for some individuals but not for others. An exceptionally well-written tale of melancholy. Each of the eight episodes completely immerses the audience in the storyline. As with the performances, the conversation with the director is mute. The sum of the team's efforts is astounding. Both must and must not be ignored. Three words: oh my God! What a collection! What a beginning for Vote Select! I've never seen anything like this on Indian television before. The script, direction, and acting are all outstanding. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 3845: This beautifully crafted web series immediately captivates its audience, bringing them deeply into the story's multiple levels. The seamless connection between episodes and the exceptional characterisation of numerous characters exemplify the series' exceptional storytelling ability. The series functions as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of modern warfare by depicting its lethal consequences. The film industry should produce a greater quantity of online programming of this calibre. Therefore, I respectfully request that Season 3 be concluded as quickly as possible. The language is excellent, and the main performance by Arshad Warsi londo the caring a compelling charactor.\n",

      "Review 3847: In this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming increasingly alienated and lonely, are we more susceptible to individuals who appear kind and logical but are actually pursuing their own agenda, vying for control over you, and willing to manipulate your thoughts and minds to do their bidding? Few action passages sandwiched by taut horror create exotic suspense. This action film is the best in a series in which the protagonist investigates gruesome murders in remote locations surrounded by breathtaking scenery. Very ingeniously conceived and carried out. Fans of the genre should not pass up this opportunity. After viewing the entire season of this programme, I feel qualified to provide cavintion torminalams.\n",
      "Review 3848: This series is distinguished by its lack of obscenity and foul language in preference of authentic substance. You may have a pleasant time with your family. If you devote seven to eight hours to this series, you will not be disappointed. Lastly, the performances and photography are both excellent. The entire series is flawless; not a single flaw exists. Asur is not only a popular programme, but it also merits its popularity. There are no flaws; everything is perfect. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. The beginning and ending background music is disquieting. It is ingrained in me. Honestly, this is one of the greatest concerts I've ever witnessed. I cannot get enough of the story, direction, and acting in this film. I completed watching Asur in one day. It is the first time I have ever viewed two Web programmes on the same day. Finally, a show with as much intelligence as western programmes. Thank you for creating such an excellent series.\n",
      "Review 3849: Due to the numerous plot developments in each episode, Asur 2 is an excellent mythological thriller that will keep you captivated until the very end. It is simply a continuation of the vile individual who consistently deceives Dhanjay Rajpoot and his group. The character has been effectively portrayed by Arshad Warsi, and the script is superb. Varun Arora and Amey Wagh are in identical circumstances. The premise of the show (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the incorporation of legendary mythology complement the plot flawlessly. Other cast members also performed admirably, but some passages were superfluous and prolonged the narrative until episode 8. If the editing had been more refined, this show's first six episodes would have been excellent. If you combine Anupriya Goenka's Hacking scenes, you'll get a 30-minute episode in which she implements (for amusement) geek-created codes.\n",
      "Review 3850: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything about Asur is superb, but the writing in particular kept me guessing until the very end. I've seen every Asur episode. It is remarkable. It is occasionally a bit sluggish, but it aids comprehension of the narrative and Indian mythology. As a consequence, I was unconcerned. I eventually witnessed a riveting Hindi programme that endured to its conclusion after a lengthy wait. This time, Arshad Warsi reprises his role as Asur on a digital projection for the audience and supporters. Fantastic film with an excellent plot and execution. All of the performers' actions are perfectly timed. Everyone involved did their utmost to make the event memorable. Thank you, Gaurav Shukla, for this magnificent work of literary art. Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team deserve congratulations. I am looking forwards to the next endeavour.\n",

After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe this programme in a few words. INTERESTING THOUGHT-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING SPELLBOUNDING After viewing the programme, I can confidently assert that it is of the highest calibre and world-class. It must be shown to audiences worldwide, not just in India. His team of writers, led by Gaurav Shukla, did an outstanding job. Thanks to Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt, Oni Sen's direction is outstanding. Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, Ridhi Dogra, Anupria Goenka, Sharib Hashmi, Gaurav Arora, and Amey Wagh deliver outstanding performances.

The series also investigates the dangers of artificial intelligence and how it could be used for evil... Here are some of the series' benefits and drawbacks: *Outstanding performances *Well-paced plot *Tense *Thought-provoking *combines mythology and science *combines mythology and science Some of the visual effects are subpar. Several plot flaws.\n",
      "Review 3853: Are we more susceptible to those who look nice and sensible but in reality are pursuing their own agenda, to hold power over you, ready to bend your ideas and minds to do their bidding, in this high tech, scientific world where we are getting alienated and lonely? Exotic suspense is created by a small number of action sequences sandwiched by moments of suspenseful terror. This action flick is the best in a series where the main character takes the spotlight and investigates grisly deaths in far-flung locales with spectacular scenery. Very well conceived and skilfully carried out. A must-see for fans of the genre. After viewing the entire season, I feel qualified to offer some descriptive language about this programme. STUNNING BREATHTAKING MIND-BLOWINGLY FANTASTIC.\n",
      "Review 3854: This is a eye opening series. Story telling , expression of All the characters are exceptionally good .Such a nice story no one can be compete this . Waiting for 3 year for season 2 is fully justified after watching the series .Specially Barun as Nikhil Nair. Storry line is extremely good. Background score & direction is the best part of the series.this series don't disappoint my expectation .It is better than the previous oneThank you Oni sen for such a master piece . Awaiting for the third season with the same cast thanku you jio cinema for providing this series for free .Again waiting for season 3.\n",
      "Review 3855: Regarding effectiveness, Asur defies concise summarization. The quantity of emotion conveyed with a single gaze was astounding. He is a brilliant forensics expert by day and a devoted father and spouse to a Scary Asur wife with whom he endeavours for reconciliation by night. What an extraordinary suspenseful novel this was! The script maintains audience interest throughout the duration of the film. Bickram Ghosh did an outstanding job with the soundscape, which was among my highlights. I felt shivers during the closing credits due to the music. I just completed watching Asur. The team, cast, and personnel have ingeniously incorporated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the conception and execution of this masterpiece. I sincerely appreciated it.\n",
      "Review 3856: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything in Asur is excellent, but the writing kept me puzzled and captivated until the very end. I have watched each episode of Asur. It is very impressive. It occasionally proceeds slowly, but this helps the reader comprehend the plot and Indian mythology. So I had no objections. After a lengthy absence, I watched an Urdu suspense that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi appears alongside Asur on a digital projection for the audience and his followers. The script and execution of this film are outstanding. Each performer has flawless action synchronisation. Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment.\n",
      "Review 3857: Everyone involved worked diligently to make the event memorable. Special appreciation is extended to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent writing he produced. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the complete team on their excellent efforts. Now, I'm awaiting my next assignment. The concept is extremely beautiful. It was great to see Arsad Warsi on television again after so long. Incredible is the concept of two universes and their struggle against evil. I chose to watch the movie despite not having seen the trailer. Asur is more than a straightforward crime thriller in which forensic specialists Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti engage in a cat-and-mouse game in quest of the self-proclaimed serial killer Asur. It causes us to doubt our morals, beliefs, and values at various junctures, as well as the decisions we make in extreme and challenging circumstances.\n",
      "Review 3858: Probably the best indian content so far. Very rarely happens that season 2 overpowers season 1 . Like sacred games season 2 disappointed. This series not only have mystery and suspence but immense depth which force you to think about your consious and decisions. Sometimes you agree with asur sometimes you agree with the protagonist. Its not only a war between good or bad its tussle between existence at what cost. It is a deadly combination of mythology and technology. This series has set the bar so high that may be now onwards i will be see any thriller suspence series with prejudice that will it be a able to match the level of asur.\n",
      "Review 3859: Each person can relate to it. So much inner meaning it has ..so much depth, detailing...so much respect to everyone of this team...best in India till now...I ever started seeing Indian webseries with asur season 1 when it released 3 years back..after that I am just waiting to see the second part..so much detailed work, acting, technology,mythology, script writing, director, everything is at best. Hopefully, it will come back with third season with so much suspense, as asur is not only a man who can be destroyed, but it's a concept that everybody has. Concept, thought process of the story is really amazing. Everyone should watch..\n",
      "Review 3860: After viewing the show, I can declare with some certainty that it is outstanding and among the best in the world. It shouldn't just be screened for Indian audiences, but for the entire world. Excellent job, both by Gaurav Shukla the inventor and by Gaurav Shukla the authors. Vinay Chhawal and Niren H. Bhatt. The Thrilling and Thrilling Series. You spend every waking moment wondering what will happen next. The character of Psycho was introduced well. The very first time I laid eyes on this series, I was hooked. It's incredible, and the premise is intriguing and perplexing in equal measure, making for a compelling web series. This is a web series that I've been telling all my friends about since it's so good.\n",
      "Review 3861: So one of the best of 2023 i think they should consider it for oscar...damm they gonna get the oscar....all the cherecters are well designed and actors are just perfect for their cast bgm is always the best...story and plot goes to to the next level...i would recommend everyone to watch this series...everything goes perfect they...made a masterpiece..why not other creater put some effort and make something like this...every cherecter has a deep meaning to their story..and the effort they put was considerable..and appreciatable..i think we can get more story like this in the sequal or prequeal which are inspired by asur of this story and wanna see that on big international level threat...\n",
      "Review 3862: Mythology meets technology. One of the standout features of this show is its strong cast of characters. Each actor brings their A-game to the table and the chemistry between the characters is absolutely electric. You'll find yourself rooting for some characters while hating others, and you won't be able to take your eyes off of them.The writing is also phenomenal, with each episode leaving you wanting more. There are unexpected plot twists and character developments that keep you engaged and guessing until the very end. The background music gives you shivers. Shubh Joshi, Keshav Bharadwaj, DJ, Rasool, Nikhil, Nusrat - All of them. Just awesome.\n",
      "Review 3863: First time second season of any webseries is more amazing.the director oni sen , the writer and the whole cast is so amazing but arshad warsi and vishesh bansal is my favourite in this webseries because we can't find any errors in both of them acting and dialogues. Dialogues are soul of this webseries in my opinion asur deserve Oscar.we need more webseries like asur, we need arshad sir more like this character actually it's not like just a any show it's like that they all are real character arshad sir as Dj amazing, Barun sobti as nikhil , vishesh bansal is best actor of this webseries and anupriya goyanka, riddhi dogra and we can't forget amay wagh plz everyone watch this webseries.\n",
      "Review 3864: Really an awesome series as this will actually blow anyone's mind . Well crafted and deserved an appreciation really loved it . Directions acting everything is on point. Big thumbs up to the makers.Great thriller and suspense and they actually knows how to make a second part and how it should be . I know asur 1 came way back and most of the people forget the story line but u can easily do a recap and start season 2 . Story line and everything was so catchy that will force you to stick on your seats and it is a series you can watch on weekends when you want to chill easily available on jio cinema for free.\n",
      "Review 3865: When it comes to its effectiveness, Asur defies succinct summation. It only took one glance, yet the depth of the emotion conveyed was remarkable. A brilliant forensics specialist by day, by night a loving father and husband to a Scary Asur wife with whom he struggles to come to terms. Wow, what a mind-blowing thriller this was. The writing maintains interest throughout the film. Bickram Ghosh did a fantastic job with the score, and it was one of the things I enjoyed the most. The closing credits with the soundtrack gave me chills. I have recently completed seeing Asur. It's incredible how expertly the team, actors, and crew have integrated their knowledge of mythology, astrology, science, and psychology into the design and production of this masterpiece. I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n",
      "Review 3866: New series on #voot; don't let the name fool you; \"asur\" means \"evil.\" As a series name, it alludes to the origin of the asur, or evil, within the human mind. The ebb and flow of priorities. To what lengths your inner asur goes to protect you. It's possible that ur idea is correct for u but incorrect for others. A masterfully written tale of darkness. There are eight episodes total, and each one will draw you farther into the plot. Everything from the script to the acting left me stunned. The group's combined effort is truly remarkable. A definite must-see. Oh my gosh!! Is all that's needed. Quite a series, huh? What a great beginning for Voot select! Such an Indian television programme has never been broadcast in the United States. The script, the directing, the acting-it was all superb. It's a fantastic blend of mystery and legend.\n",
      "Review 3867: This meticulouslyconstructed web series effortlessly captivates its audience, luring them into its narrative's intricate layers. The exceptional portrayal of numerous characters and the seamless connection between episodes attest to the series' exceptional storytelling ability. By depicting the devastating effects of technological warfare, the series serves as a stark reminder of its far-reaching consequences. It is imperative that the film industry creates more web series with scripts of this calibre. Therefore, I implore the creators to develop Season 3 as soon as possible. The series' mystifying quality is enhanced by Arshad Warsi's mesmerising performance in the lead role, while the dialogue is commendable.\n",
      "Review 3868: And, in this high-tech, scientific world where we are becoming more isolated and lonely, are we becoming more susceptible to individuals who appear cordial and reasonable but are actually pursuing their own agenda, wielding control over you, and prepared to corrupt your thoughts and ideas? A few life-or-death action situations generate unusual tension among the audience. The hero takes centre stage and conducts body searches in exotic locales, and the scenery is so breathtaking that it generates tension until the very end and is excellent overall. Outstandingly competent writing and performance! A must-see for fans of suspense! After viewing the entire season, I would like to describe the programme with a few adjectives. INTRIGUING THINK-PROVOKING INCREDIBLE MIND-BLOWING BEWITCHING.\n",
      "Review 3869: This beautifully crafted web series immediately captivates its audience, bringing them deeply into the story's multiple levels. The seamless connection between episodes and the exceptional characterisation of numerous characters exemplify the series' exceptional storytelling ability. The series functions as a sombre reminder of the far-reaching effects of modern warfare by depicting its lethal consequences. The film industry should produce a greater quantity of online programming of this calibre. Therefore, I respectfully request that Season 3 be concluded as quickly as possible. The language is excellent, and the main performance by Arshad Warsi lends the series a compelling character.\n",
      "Review 3870: As the title of a new #voot series, the term asur, which means \"evil,\" refers to the origin of asur within the human body. The manner in which one priority replaces another. The manner in which your inner fury saves your life. Your viewpoint may be correct for some individuals but not for others. An exceptionally well-written tale of melancholy. Each of the eight episodes completely immerses the audience in the storyline. As with the performances, the conversation with the director is mute. The sum of the team's efforts is astounding. Both must and must not be ignored. Three words: oh my God! What a collection! What a beginning for Vote Select! I've never seen anything like this on Indian television before. The script, direction, and acting are all outstanding. It's a fantastic blend of crime and mythology.\n",
      "Review 3871: The performance of Asur cannot be summarised in a single phrase. It is easy to communicate profound emotions with a single, straightforward expression. Intelligent forensics expert turned family man, devoted father, and emotionally conflicted spouse. This was a fantastic novel of suspense. The plot holds your interest throughout the duration of the film. I appreciated the excellent work that Bickram Ghosh did with the background music. I experienced shivers during the final scene's BGM. I have just completed watching Asur. It is astounding how gorgeously mythology, astrology, science, and psychological research have been woven into the conception and implementation of this masterpiece; congratulations to the entire team, actors, and staff! I enjoyed each syllable!\n",
      "Review 3872: After observing the performance, I can say with absolute certainty that it is of the highest calibre and quality. It must be exhibited to audiences worldwide, not just in India. Gaurav Shukla, the creator and author, has performed admirably. Authors are Niren H. Bhatt and Vinay Chhawal. Suspense prevails throughout the series. You agonise about the future every minute and second. Excellent summary of the Psycho character. I was instantly drawn to this series upon my initial exposure to it. It's truly mind-boggling, and the story's premise is both intriguing and perplexing, which adds to the web series' intrigue. I frequently recommend this excellent online series to my peers, and I also enjoy viewing it myself.\n",
      "Review 3873: You, Arshad Warsi, killed it. It has an incredible plot and is expertly directed. All of the characters performed their roles exceptionally well. Just concluded Asur, the finest web series in Hindi that combines science and Hindu philosophy. Excellent work, buddy! I can't wait for the sequel! Asur will receive every award this year. This web series is rated a perfect 10 out of 10 for its excellent acting, production, and plot. What did I just complete... I've decided to view this once all the episodes are available, and guess what? They released them on the weekend. I still can't get over it... Who is Kali? When will this end? Clever writing will leave you pondering what will occur next. I can only pray that the time creators and publishers do not take too long.\n",
      "Review 3874: This series is distinguished by its lack of depravity and foul language. It can be enjoyed with family. This series deserves 7-8 hours of your time; you will not be disappointed. Last but not least, the acting and cinematography are excellent. There is not a single flaw within the entire series. Asur is not only a highly rated series, but it also merits its status. I found no flaws in this; everything is excellent. I'm experiencing an Asur hangover. The opening and closing background music are eerie. It is ingrained in my mind. In all honesty, it's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. Cannot cease praising the script, direction, and acting. Just viewed Asur in a single day. This is the first time I've ever watched an entire Web series in one day. Finally, a programme with intelligence on par with westerns. Thank you for providing such an exceptional series.\n",
      "Review 3875: Asur 2 is a perfectmythological thriller with twists and turns that unravel in every episode. It's essentially a recurring group of villains who con Dhanjay Rajpoot and his team. Arshad Warsi has done the character, which is so well written, justice. The same is true of Varun Arora and Amey wagh. The concept on which this show is founded (artificial intelligence for user behaviour and prediction) and the blend of the mythological story suit the show's plot flawlessly. Other Starcast members have also performed admirably, but some sequences are so lengthy that they are superfluous and extend the narrative to episode 8. If the editing had been tight, this programme would have been ideal for six episodes. If you are assembling Hacking sequences by Anupriya Gokhale Fun aside, it will be a 30-minute short episode in which she executes algorithms written by geeks for nerds.\n",
      "Review 3876: There is an editing error in the scene where Arshad Warsi and Anupriya are tormenting a character. Everything about Asur is excellent, including the writing, which kept me intrigued and speculating until the very end. I have watched every episode of Asur. It's so incredibly delicious. It is a little sluggish at times, but this allows you to better comprehend the story and Indian mythology. So I didn't dislike it. After a very long time, I watched an urdu thriller that held my attention until the very end. This time, Arshad Warsi is on digital screen with Asur for the audience and his admirers. Superb film with excellent writing and execution. All actors have impeccable action coordination. Everyone involved did their best to make it unforgettable. Special gratitude to Gaurav Shukla for the excellent work of writing that he produced. Also to the excellent performance of Niren Bhatt, Abhijit, and the entire team. Currently awaiting the next assignment.\n",

      "Review 3878: In First Season we will dive into the Asur world and U Just start to experience something very new and fresh content from the Indian perspective and culture.Second Season was little less curious than the First season.(It might be something like_if you're experiencing any new content for the first time it will be more impacting than the latter)-but i don't think so.I hope third will be as mysterious as the first one.I liked 2nd season too but 1%less than the 1st season.Phenomenal acting by Barun Sobti-He deserves it. Series deserves to be dubbed into various languages of India to be witnessed by various parts of India.\n",
      "Review 3879: I mean you would never watch something like I can bet this! It's just pure with the storytelling , acting of all the actors. After ages something has came up like this. You won't regret the time you invested. We all know spirituality as the superphenomanal path of eternal peace and positivity but we also must know the opposite side of it to know the major differences between it that somehow are mixing with our consciousness naturally nowadays and growing. Now my expectations with season 3 is super high. I hope and wish they don't disappoint us. Working on these contexts is like a ocean the more you get deep into it, more you will be appreciated.\n",
      "Review 3880: Best web series i have ever seen it contains all the aspects of modern life including ancient scriptures and their teachings. Role of shubh was very wonderful,thrilling, suspicious and horrific his hindi accent was possessive and his geniusness was greatIt also provides a very wonderful experience on perspective of mastermind like shubh and dhnanajayaThe working , motivation, inspiration and thinking of the CBI and ATF officers were inspirationalI gaied much experience about technology, dharma, knowledge, rational thinking, excellent observer and many moreAnd finally i want to say that i am really excited for asur season 3.\n",

      "Review 3884: This is my first ever review and I am writing this out of anger as some lousy writing has ruined a show which could have been spectacular and would have been rated as high as \"Breaking Bad\". Unnecessarily so many loop holes were created which could have been avoided by some thoughtful writing.But without getting too much critical and pointing out only negative, i would just say please correct them in next season. Arshad sir you have been always exceptional and like few other stars you have been under utilized by the Bollywood.Although the show had many faults but it was so incredible that somehow it went unnoticed. Only when once the season ends and you think over it again peacefully you will realize what all was missing.For once I would have given 10/10 but the later half just blew it away.Still a must watch, powerful story with nice mix of mythology and suspense. And wonderful effort by all the members. Please support these kind of projects financially.Strongly recommended.\n",
      "Review 3885: Concept: 9/10, Acting: 7/10, Storytelling: 6/10, Direction: 4/10It is very rare to bounce upon a plot that has a great premise, is told in a intriguing way, and has characters that can leave you in awe. Asur started well, but lost its charm with poor acting and even poorer execution. Most of the characters were acted very loosely except maybe the one by Arshad Warsi. Reality was tweaked to pull off a poorly written story. CBI representation for example was well off.Overall, story and concept saved the day. It is worth one watch.\n",

All through the series the good guys are chasing illogical clues and rub it on us that they are some kind of geniuses.Plot twists are really foolish and amateur. Screenplay is boring and lengthy .Acting is good.Story is literally forced on you.I gave 3 stars only for the acting.Overall , SKIP\n",

      "Review 3920: Apart from first and last episode, it's a drag like any other typical Bollywood product. One of the most potential Bollywood villain wasted like anything. Sloppy storyline, below than average acting, unwanted drama and too much of mythology has towed it lower and lower.\n",

      "Review 3922: This is exactly what I needed at this very moment. A genuine dark compelling thriller with proper acting, proper film making and actual mythological approach behind. I know it is a very specific and unorthodox taste. Asur shines in everything related to the dark side of human nature. It's masterful entanglement of dark hindu myths with the plot and plot's execution is up there with the tops.Asur is a must watch. You will enjoy every episode to the fullest. The story is simply mind blowing. You will truly see something that you have never seen before.\n",

If not these, an unbelievable Arshad Warsi steals the show. Binge it, you won't regret it!\n",
      "Review 3925: Arshad warsi has done full justice to his character and played so well. Baron sobti and riddhi dogra were great and sharab hashmi is a gem. A must watch and i think this will break record of Scared games and mirzapur. Waiting for SEASON 2.\n",
      "Review 3926: Asur is truly a gem for Indian webseries. We hardly get good movies or series in India and thriller drama is a very difficult genre here. The cinematography and direction is top notch and is comparable to hollywood thrillers. Most of all the movie kept it's originality and the plot wasn't twisted at all.This kind of cinema should be appreciated by the Indian audience. Arshad Warsi was perfect in his role and each actor does deserve an applause.Kudos to the makers for making this masterpiece.A MUST WATCH !!\n",
      "Review 3927: This is one of the best tv series i have ever watched. The cast is so amazing. They have done such an amazing job. The plot is wonderful, such an interesting plot with so many turns in the story. I hope more seasons come. I will just binge watch it again. The actors did such an awsome job. Arshad warsi is the best.\n",
      "Review 3928: The story deviates from its line and a respected institution is shown to be very careless.\n",
      "Review 3929: Asura has an amazing story to it's core. Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti both have given power packed performances. it is something different than the usual storylines that we see. The story intertwines with the Indian mythology in a fashion that will just amaze you. I'm all praises for this show. Must watch.\n",
      "Review 3930: ASUR is a captivating web series that keeps you on the edge of your seat with its gripping storyline and intense performances. From the very first episode, it grabs your attention and takes you on a rollercoaster ride of suspense and psychological intrigue.What sets ASUR apart is its ability to seamlessly weave ancient Indian mythology into a modern-day crime drama. The show brilliantly blends elements of mythology, forensics, and technology to create a unique and immersive experience. The intricate plot keeps you guessing, constantly unveiling new layers and twists that leave you craving for more.Can't wait for Season-2 to find out real Shubh/Kali and his plans for incarnation of Kalki (10th avatar of Lord Vishnu).\n",
      "Review 3931: First 7 episodes established very well for final episode which is total disaster.\n",
      "Review 3932: Asur is an impeccable thriller which does not fail to amaze you as the series progresses. The flow of the show is smooth and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The direction and cinematography of the show is well executed and is perfectly suited for the tone of the show.\n",
      "Review 3933: I saw the thumb on youtube and trailer recommendation ....but I didn't watched it,....becoz I haven't heard about it......no previous hype created regarding star cast .....they just releasd it within a week....so a person told me that it's good....that's when I started watching it around evening....and by 5:30 in the morning I couldn't sleep without completing 1st season......it's that good...and now I just want a confirmation for its second season\n",
      "Review 3934: Everything is good except Arshad Varasi overacting\n",
      "Review 3935: One of the best Indian web series. Well written, well acted, amazing screenplay and cinematography, amazing soundtrack\n",
      "Review 3936: What strikes me most about the show is the infusion of Indian mythology, which makes it unique. I know there are a lot of plot holes, but perhaps perfection would't have given us this type of a story. And about the ending, it is extremely dark and sets up a brilliant season 2. It is very brave of the creators to go that path. While for the acting, it is a mixed bag with quite a lot of wonderful moments from all the characters but some average moments too. But I was really impressed with Vishesh Bansal as young Shubh, his mannerisms and resolve as the character was a joy to watch. It is quite a stark change from TVF's Yeh Meri Family and he as a young actor taking up these roles with aplomb is great.All in all, it is a game changer in Indian TV Series setup.\n",
      "Review 3937: This is no doubt the best web series to come out of India so far. the webseries bar is set very high with Sacred Games, Mirzapur, Ghoul but this one is definitely The Beast (Asur). Pun intended.gripping and addictive from the first scene I couldn't stop and finished it in 2 nights.\n",
      "Review 3938: Arshad Warsi, undeniably amazing actor under any circumstances, give him any thing and he makes the best of it.Coming to story line, no doubt in the quality of it, science and mythology conflicting and correlating at every walk of life. Worth the time, please do watch the series and get entertained\n",
      "Review 3939: One of the best indian web series I've ever watched. After one episode curiosity rises a lot and I just finished the whole series in just one day. Strongly recommended.\n",
      "Review 3940: Everything in this series is so perfectly represented. The best part of the series is it's story line and well maintained suspense. Acting is also we'll performed.It also leaves clue for it's second season.\n",
      "Review 3941: Overall mind blowing show ! I literally had to binge watch it but some how the ending raised ambiguity. Could have been a better ending. Had high hopes ok how it would end but didn't live up to my expectations. But worth a watch.\n",
      "Review 3942: So 3 years back a series dropped in Voot an app which was famous for shows like big hoss.. Splitsvilla Roadies etc.. They casually dropped a show named ASUR.. AND my oh my what a terrific and steller series it was.. Quickly became one of the finest indian series.. Then came S2 after 3 long years..AND...its a MASTERPIECE..now its not one of the.. Balki..its THE BEST INDIAN SERIES EVER by miles.. WOW WOW and WOW..Oni Sen and team has made something so perfect i highly doubt that any other tv series in India can even match 50% of what ASUR 2 has achieved..the DETAILING in the show is so so good.. Every aspect be it Acting..Screenplay.. dialogues.. Cinematography..its pure perfection...‚ù§‚ù§Foreign countries have masterpiece shows like Breaking Bad...GOT...Dark..etc.. i can proudly say we have ASUR ..‚ù§üôè‚ù§üôè‚ù§\n",
      "Review 3943: Asur is both alluring and compelling enough in its first season to binge-watch it at one go.Evokes many common serial killer troops and gives it a mythological flavour, it marks a fine debut of Arshad Warsi in the OTT platform, while also showcasing an incredible show from Barun Sobti. recommended!\n",
      "Review 3944: No words. Top notch performance by the cast . Everything is on cue from start to end. It does leave you with feeling that let's skip this part or something like that. I was amazed with the concept of Kali vs Kalki and the portrayal in current time frame is just wow. The story is such that it flows with the prediction and suddenly something unexpected happens which thrills only Barun seemed sometimes clueless about what's happening or to what to do. Young Shubh was amazing while adult one could not do justice to that impact of Shubh Joshi. Anupriya as always looks stunning in whatever role she plays.Conclusion -must watch if love thrillers.\n",
      "Review 3945: The show which starts off very well couldn't sustain the same momentum in the last few episodes.. Toomany logical loopholes somehow spoils the overall experience..\n",
      "Review 3946: This is a web series that brings a new direction to the Indian web series world.\n",
      "Review 3947: A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.Asur is more a psychology than a thriller and a detective. How are decisions made, how do decisions affect our loved ones and the world around us? Why do we value our loved ones less than we depend on them? What trials must a heart pass before understanding his feelings? What is the reason for senseless cruelty and is there any way to resist it? A very complex, multifaceted series about the personal and the eternal.\n",
      "Review 3948: A power-packed thriller.. Should have released on bigger platform than voot.... Like if it had released on Netflix or Amazon prime.. That would have taken this series to next level\n",
      "Review 3949: I just started first episode and got soo much hooked to it and watched it completely. it's a thrilling series with the Indian mythological things which makes it a must watch.After watching this I found that Arshad Warsi is too underated actor in our industry.And again I would love to give much of the credit to the negative character with the shuddh hindi and Sanskrit used by this character.\n",
      "Review 3950: It is a Masterpiece of Suspense. The first season was on the born of Asur whereas this season is such a Rise of Asur. The series does a great job of blending Mythology and Technology. The real hero is Story and it's execution. It provides deep knowledge of Indian Culture and Mythology. Amazingly written and perfectly executed. The performances are top-notch, with Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti giving particularly memorable turns. Vishesh Bansal (Child Shubh) is such an amazing actor with conviction in his eyes. The series also explores the dangers of Artificial Intelligence and how it could be used for evil purposes.\n",
      "Review 3951: The series keeps you hooked to the screen till the very end of it. It is good to see Arshad Warsi on the screen again. I would highly recommend people to watch this series especially if you enjoyed the Netflix special- Sacred Games and Prime special- Mirzapur. As mentioned in the title of the series, the series is dark and does make you uncomfortable at times but it never disappoints you.\n",
      "Review 3952: One Sad Thing that If you have already watched True Detective or others like Dexter then you wouldn't resist but comparing Asur with those. It seemed little too dramatic. Murder Scenes/ Strategy could have been better or more realistic. Otherwise would have given 10/10.All actors did their job pretty well. One more thing I would like is if they had finished the story in the first season itself. But obviously then they wouldn't get to earn more money. I don't just understand this typically mentality. Instead of pulling the same story towards second season, you could have invested more effort/ strategy in the first one and that could have brought more popularity.\n",
      "Review 3953: I have watched almost 10-11 English and Hindi series . Nothing felt so mind blowing like this one.\n",
      "Review 3954: Great web series .better than other web series .must watch it\n",
      "Review 3955: The trailer for this show looks promising. With a versatile cast like Arshad Warsi and Barun Sobti, I am really excited to watch the show. It looks like a perfect combination of mystery, thrill and action.\n",
      "Review 3956: This is an amazing watch! I loved it. It was an amazing experience watching this. It got me so hooked that I couldn't stay away!\n",
      "Review 3957: When all hopes were going down for something new in web series.Only abusing language are made the definition of web series.Than comes a masterpiece \"ASUR\"It is best combination of mythology and science and you and also say it is modern science Vs mythology.Out of the world story line . Hollywood lvl thrilling and flawless acting .This web series has power to change your thoughts about good and bad, God and devil.You and also understand the meaning of philosophy and psychology..So I strongly recommend to you for this web series.It comes top of my favourite Indian web series.My top 5 web series1-Asur2-Sacred games3-The family man4-Kota factory5-Apharan\n",
      "Review 3958: The story is gripping like the characters are. Kudos to the Voot for making one of the best mythological series.\n",
      "Review 3959: Great storyline. Twisting suspense story. A must watch series. Great series on voot.\n",
      "Review 3960: A great thriller. Holds you till the end. Parrellel story telling in each episode is brilliant rather than fumbling within episode. Also mythical aspect & modern adaption is unique selling point of this webseries.Eager to see 2nd season asap\n",

It was sucha good movie with the graphics and worth while experience can't just can't wait for it to make it till the greater awards the script and the dialogue dilvery was on point !\n",
      "Review 3964: After hearing some amazing reviews for this series, I have it a watch.The story is amazing and gripping, but the script writing, direction and scene writing is just painful.We see police work on gut feeling. One other painful instance was that this series gave an answer to the world famous trolley problem. We don't see the police take important steps that one should expect them to take. Despite DJ realising the presence of a mole in the team, does nothing to adjust accordingly.It's a decent series to watch with the family. But it contains uncensored cuss words.All in all, story 4/5, direction 2/5, script 1/5, acting 3/5.\n",
      "Review 3965: Best show ever.I feel like everyone should watch itObviously would not give any spoilers whatsoever but it's mind blowingA must watch show and changes your perspective towards various things in life. Please do watch and make others watch too\n",
      "Review 3966: Best series secred game ka baapBest best best best\n",
      "Review 3967: The web series is a psychological crime drama that focuses on ruthless murders by a serial killer. The plot and storyline is so unique that it is definitely going to leave you on the edge of your seats at all times. It is an amazing mixture of science and human psychology. Don't miss out on it.\n",
      "Review 3968: Brilliant story line which is beautifully complimented by direction. The music is a cherry on top which mesmerizes you. Overall a brilliant show and this is something which the Indian entertainment industry has been missing for a long time. A must watch, cause you are in for a treat!!You won't be disappointed....\n",
      "Review 3969: The writing and depth this series attempts and triumphs is a legendary experience to binge\n",
      "Review 3970: Asur is a marvelously well knit story with a disappointing end. It starts off great. All episodes are under 30 minutes with interesting cliffhangers that will keep you hooked and will leave you wanting for more. But it's sad that the end feels more forced does not tie ends as expected. The expectations were heightened with a magnificent beginning. The closing episode is of an hour length and the only episode that exceeds 30 minutes mark.However, except for that closing episode, it is indeed a treat to watch with great mythological Hindu references.It's a must watch!\n",
      "Review 3971: A well Directed Series i say. Background music ,theme everything is perfectly matched. And The Story is much strong that will trilled your Every Heart-Bit. though , it's a mind blowing series. !!\n",
      "Review 3972: Truly a masterpiece.This came as a recommendation to me by a friend, and believe me i was truly stunned by its script. Oni Sen has done a beautiful job, by mixing Indian mythology with contemporary society. This show is at par with Sacred Games(season 1). I wish this show doesnt go underrate as many other amazing tv shows go. Hpyed for seasn 2.\n",
      "Review 3973: It is an excellent work, gripping, deep in philosophy, actors were all ok infact dull in most occasion...including arshad.....but the story telling was the best part of it. As a medico choice of medicine used in last episode were far from near....hire a professional. I am not religious or have any idea abt devta or asur. This series has made me think abt philosophy differently then commonly thought ........I loved it.\n",
      "Review 3974: This is mind blowing suspense thriller which keeps you guessing all the time.Everything is good about Asur, Be it the writing which kept me hooked and guessing till last. Or the Actors, Director, music. Completely a worth watch. Waiting for season 2.\n",
      "Review 3975: Asur is packed with thriller. The content is undoubtedly outstanding. It is a must watch movie filled with top notch suspense. The storyline is unique so that gives another reason to watch it. All the actors have done their job at its cusp. Such a marvelous acting by Jeet. Hats off to the script.\n",
      "Review 3976: It was really a quite thriller film in my experience. I loved watching it. The Cinematography was excellent.It is the new age Bengali cinema. And it is an excellent example of good film making.It makes an impact with the audience with a potent mix of reality and fiction\n",
      "Review 3977: I didn't like much as its seems very easy for criminal to access all the area .... from high security zone to jail to house of CBI officer which seems very very stupid and unrealistic..... on the contrary they are trying to connect incidents with real place and real people have real status in our current society.....the way the revenge incidents are happening are also too stupid .... music seems to be inspired by GOT and the way murders are happening aalso not so logical...Its better they would have made these series in mythological era only ... like some fictional city/ world and different lifestyle.... Really very confusing as they tried to mix mythology, science, real characters and modern lifestyle.....\n",
      "Review 3978: This is the best TV show Indian cinema ever createdAlthough people can ignore it from its production voot.\n",
      "Review 3979: Usually I am not interested in watching web series. But now during this lock down , I watched ASUR . Very well written story line,well chosen actors and actresses. From beginning till end , I had the eagerness of knowing next scene. Waiting for the second season of it. Well done ARSHAD WARSI SIR AND BARUN SOBTI SIR. A good master and student combo.\n",
      "Review 3980: Totally loved it A handful of action between fear of life and death set pieces set an exotic excitement amongst viewers. Action is a series of seen it together with the hero taking centre stage and doing searches with bodies in some exotic locations and the sets are amazing it creates excitement till the end and its overall amazing.\n",
      "Review 3981: Total bakwaas...no logics at all..concept good but pathetic implementatiom\n",

The story had everything mythology, psychology, forensics, great background music and a great storyline on top of that. Amazing acting performances and the direction is flawless. Overall, a great web series. Will wait for more such series.\n",

      "Review 3994: Asur is the coming together of such creative minds. Its got a thrilling plot, throughtout the series you feel like you are so close to cracking the mystery yet you're far, which keeps you engaged craving to know what the truth is. The performances were brilliant, especially by Arshad and Barun. Superbly impressed by the execution of the script. I was so hooked managed to finish it in a single sitting. Its a breath of fresh air, with a different outlook on mythology, Asurs , etc. despite being a work of fiction, its relevance and symbolism with the current situations in our world manages to give you chills. Its a must watch. Wish it was available on a bigger platform so most would have access to it.\n",
      "Review 3995: It is a phenomenal combination of acting and storytelling. The whole cast performed really well and the dialogues were weaved very beautifully throughout the whole movie.A fairly good movie you won't regret watching.The storyline was amazing though it went a little off in the middle but the climax was worth it.\n",
      "Review 3996: I'm really happy with this kind of entertainment content. Its a great way to address an issue. Execution could have been better.\n",
      "Review 3997: Asur is a story of a man fighting his inner demons and troubled childhood in the garb of myth, dharma and religion. They give him an excuse to position himself as a mythical figure in the modern era and to be a mastermind behind a series of killings in India in the name of social justice.\n",

      "Review 4000: Best blend of Indian Mythology and Science in a crime thriller I have seen in a long time. Frist 6 episodes are very well written with very minor loops. But episode 7 and episode 8 has some loop holes which makes you not to believe in the climax or rather they had kept it that way, but for me it could had been better.\n",

Amazing screenplay and awesome acting lifts it to perfection. We fall in love with characters and get inspired by them too. Everyone gotta watch it, especially Indians, because when we hear \"series\" then we only think about long high drama nonsense ones. Those directors must learn from these people. It says many things without doing so. Too bad it will never air in India on televisions because of the brainless censor board.Ps: I watched all the episodes at once. It makes it much better.\n",
      "Review 4004: This is a mind blowing thriller series . Which has a different type of suspence . Every slot has a twist in itself . Where in the 2 officers have to find a serial killer before he takes a big action. It's is worth to watch asur . Waiting for the next season to come hope the second season will be full with more suspence .\n",

I spent the whole day watching the movie and the other half of the processing what happened because it's that good.I recommended it to all my friends and tbh i didnt expect a hindi show to be this exciting and so well characterised. kudos to the team.\n",
      "Review 4009: The \"dark side\" itself makes a suspense thriller for the audience. Each eposide has some unique and never seen before kind of creativity which hooks the audience. The team kept it brief so that the audience won't feel bored even for a second.\n",
      "Review 4010: A very very well made show. Has to be one such show which remained true to its genre. Indeed a psychological thriller. Makes to believe at the same time you are forced to question things. A different take on what makes people do what they do. Like they said.. everyone has a dark side. Beautifully executed and crisp screenplay with less or no loopholes. Above all a great team of actors to justify the whole thing. Barun Sobti is as always doing what he does best which is his amazing and natural way to perform. Brilliant show.\n",
      "Review 4011: Totally disappointed at last. director leaved space for the next season.\n",
      "Review 4012: I'm very much appreciate whole team for making a realisiting crime investigation series. But Please please put some extra effort on cyber related scene. Its too dump.

      "Review 4022: Usually it's always difficult to make a good serial killer story, but Dahaad is so beautifully written and directed that I coup help but binge watched the entire season in a day. And while telling a gruesome story of a psychopath the story points out to many flaws in our society, from gender biasness, caste system, and social pressure on girls to marry and of course the dowry system in India. But none of this social messages were nicely woven into the story and didn't appear as a propaganda. One of the best series in hindi in recent times. Very well written, edited, executed, acted and above all perfect casting. Good to see Sonakshi Sinha being utilised to her potential. All the characters are so well developed and performed by each actors. Vijay Verma's performance is so good, that no adjectives are enough for that. There are times seeing Vijay Verma's character will give you a skin crawling feeling. At times his subtle performance was so good that he reminded me of Irfan Khan.\n",
      "Review 4023: I fail to understand the low ratings... it may not be technically proficient but content is amazing.. very nicely crafted.. achievement is that even knowing the culprit you are still glued to it... Acting is of highest order.. be it Sinha or Varma or / and all sundry characters.. Sinha in particular has excelled.. she actually looks the part.. Varma as always is comes across as a very genuine actor.. the expressions and nuances he brings to his role is simply mind blowing.. not to forget Gulshan and Sohum... beautifully restrained... direction is superb.. so guys pls watch it and don't believe the cynics and naysayers.\n",
      "Review 4024: Made beautifully and authentically. Every single character has acted wonderfully. The locations, the production, the direction. The storyline is a perfect 10 out of 10. Very well done. It's a good ensemble cast. And it's very captivating.it's hard to stop once you start. Well done entire cast & directors. I have not enjoyed a lot of Indian content online recently, but I highly recommend this one. This is probably Sonakshi Sinha's best work. And zodiac thought is always brilliant. Please don't mess this out. I saw the seven rating and didn't expect much from it. But it actually deserves a nine rating on IMDb.\n",
      "Review 4025: I don't get why the series is getting bad reviews from mainstream media. It is an excellent series with good acting, a well-paced story and backed by a good score.It's gripping and unsettling. The screenplay is realistic. The writing is actually my favourite thing about this series. It captures both the apathy and tenacity of police in India. Its subtle commentary on Indian society is accurate af. It captures, very perfectly, the struggle women face, especially in rural and semi-rural India. And it does so in a thriller, wherein the viewer already knows who the killer is... that is not an easy feat.Binge worthy series.\n",
      "Review 4026: This series is about the famous hot and spicy topic\"Intrrcaste marriage or so called love jihad\",its also about the pain of socially low caste people it's also about any mother's worry for her daughter's marriage it's also about a girl's desire to become financially independent. But now the thing is that what's new and why to watch this series. Now this series is a crime thriller and its a treat to your eyes and brain together Beautifully presented and once you start it,you would definitely love the ride of this series. Totally a paisa wasool series. This series also is an eye opener for everyone which says any person around us may be a psychopath and we should think twice before trusting any stranger.\n",
      "Review 4027: It's a wonderful web series blended with full suspense and thrill. It will bind you from stating to end you will definitely enjoy each episode.congrats to Sonakshi for great acting in web series debew. All actors acting is very good. Engaging and full of entertainment. The story concept is new and open a new era of serial killing related movies and web series. Story is unique and make you think. Hats off for the director for perfect execution. This series also gives message for small town villages girls and their parents. This series also an eye opener for small villages in our country where casteism still present in this 21st century.A MUST WATCH......\n",
      "Review 4028: The story and show was good and entertaining, Gulshan and Soham have played there roles very nicely without adding any overacting masala like Sonakshi Sinha WHO SOMEHOW is the lead of this show and angry with everyone for no reason. It looks like the serious was made only for her and other actors were just in the series to fill the gap. Had someone better then Sonakshi Sinha the show would've killed it.The story is very interesting and a must watch for people who have the patience to tolerate overacting by the lead actor who is also playing the role of ANGRY BIRD without any reason she is mean from Scene 1 till the end.\n",
      "Review 4029: I am a big fan of this genre, so I was very excited to watch this series, even though it has Sonakshi Sinha in it.But very soon my excitement turned to agony, and by the end of the first episode, it eventually turned to wrath.As a Hindu (I am talking about those Hindus who love their religion like people of other religions do), it is very difficult to get something from Bollywood where your religion is not mocked. They showcase Hindus as bigots, criminals, mostly in a negative spirit, and Muslims as victims.Apart from that, this series has nothing new. You can take a break for a couple of minutes and come back; you'll probably find the story in the same place.\n",
      "Review 4030: This is better than most of the garbage Indian series out there. Story is gripping with some very good actors . The depiction of the serial killer is unique and transcends the cliched bloody and gruesome maniac. The screenplay could have been better.The depiction of the police work, Indian caste system and discrimination is well portrayed. Though many will try to ridicule it , this is still the sad reality of Indian society. The lower classes still have a hard time to get justice and so called \"upper class\" people try to influence the police .This is definitely worth a watch. Just a good thriller series with the underlying message of the harsh societal reality still prevalent in many parts of India.\n",
      "Review 4031: Overacting and over attitude of Sonakshi sinha... Plus conscious effort to bring caste issues are clearly visible in series ... Though such issues are finding no place in real society ... I would advise makers to step out of their AC rooms and see the real India, which is marking its way to science , technology, literature , art and medicines... The series gives clear view of bias from makers of macaulay's mindset... I would advise them to open up their eyes to see the Indian audience is not the same as it's was in sholays time ... Plz start learning from reviews of previous Bollywood movies who tried it and got destroyed themselves... It's an era of awakening consciousness of Indian soil...Learn it or get ready to be doomed.\n",
      "Review 4032: Superb actors like Vijay verma, Gulshan wasted due to slow and poor script and lackluster direction, on top of that it's very divisive screenplay, made with typical Bollywood agenda. I wanted to watch it till end but can not! Why such good actors chose such poor series is beyond my comprehension. Watch it only if you enjoy mediocracy and have not watched good thrillers like family.man, stoneman murders etc. Invest your time in watching good shows ,your brain and heart will bless you.vijay verma has acted well as usual. Gulshan has been wasted and Sonakshi has lost her edge long long back, if ever there was an edge to her acting .\n",
      "Review 4033: JAI BHEEM JAI MEEM! This is what it has, that's it.I have a house in a small village in Bihar surrounded by lower caste (most of us, Sanatanis, don't believe it like Harivansh Rai Bachchan etc.). We, usually, celebrate festivals together, eat together (since 30-35 years)... Discriminations were present at that time but at few houses and, now, it's only at couple of houses. In this series, how come each and every individual (except one) of Hindu upper caste is victimizing Muslims and lower caste (in today's period in Mandawa, Rajasthan)?Useless to share many other observations...pathetic.Watched only episode 1...couldn't dared to watch other episodes.\n",
      "Review 4034: Few observations if police questions any one they go and ask for identification not sure does the same rule applies here. Web series does show Sonakshi making lot of effort but unfortunately story is stupid it's just agenda to put male bashing and castist remarks the same old dialogues that they kept pushing in mirzqpur in one scene central character goes to meet the boy for wedding and few scenes before the same character is going out and having an affair with the boy. I am not sure what were they trying to convey here central character is living in a small town yet she goes and says she was in non committed relationship. One actress shown as someone's wife being labeled as backward and central character is labeled very forward.\n",
      "Review 4035: A good story and a premise wasted with lengthy narration and too much unwanted scenes. It would have been a great watch if was filmed in 3 episodes but unfortunately the director makes you feel frustrated and just you just feel like how much more will she drag it... the story misses basic common sense like the police always spies on the chief suspects which they never get to do unfortunately in this series. The moment we come to know about the circumstances of the deaths we can easily guess that the victim was given the poison in the guise of morning after pill.. Sonakshi Sinha is the only saving grace of this series...go for it if you want a slow torture for audience. It's a snooze worthy series.\n",
      "Review 4036: I watched the show only for vijay verma. And he never disappoints. Sonakshi sinha could be better anyways. Watching Vijay verma in negative role is a dream come true. It's slightly slow series but will keep u in suspense and thrill. Many people are criticizing the accent of sonakshi, but i don't have any knowledge about the real Rajasthani accent so it was okok thing for me. But if you are more considerate about the accent. You will find it lacking too. Overall the show is fine and a little new, but predictable concept is there. So move your asses and watch it now. If you're a rajasthani you will relate more.\n",
      "Review 4037: Insecurities of the makers was visible. They had nothing new to present, the same story resold so many times type. Poor narrative, extremely bad acting by Gulshan Devaiah and Star kid Sonakshi who had the same expressions throughout. Unnecessary insertion of Altaf Thakur angle and Sonakshi's boy toy for no reason but to prove what a power feminist the character is and the dark casteist and anti particular community behaviour in India. End of the day it seemed all artificial. The story was dragged too long and you begin to start getting bored by episode number three. By episode 8 it was a fast forward to end it all. Amazon Prime is loosing its quality day by day it seems by signing such content. The only positive was under utilised Sohum Shah and Vijay Varma. Skip this to save time and headache, the 8+ ratings seem fake to me.\n",
      "Review 4038: Its a grim,dark story, deals with the motivations of a serial killer in quite depth..the casting has to be one of the best in recent times, character building and story arc have been done nicely..it also deals with some social issues such as caste based discrimination, interreligion marriages etc.The direction does enough to keep viewers engaged with the story and see where it leads to next.Acting has to be one of the strongest points and the serial killer character has been done almost impeccably.Good to see such thought provoking shows, hopefully more of these would come rather than the mass pleasing unnecessary serieses.\n",
      "Review 4039: The show is one of the must watch!!! Brilliant acting by all actors!!! Nice way of telling story!!! If you are a crime/drama lover then you will defiantly enjoy it!!! Audience go with Bhati to Catch Swarnkaar!!! Can be more seasons as anthology series. The way of story telling keep you engaged through out the series. You also want to catch Swarnkar as much as Bhati wants to catch. Beside this Swarnkar play by Vijay Verma is also one of the best performances . No surprise if we see more Vijay Verma on screen in other projects.Hope makers will make more seasons as continuing it as anthology series.\n",
      "Review 4040: Blind to the facts...this series fails to impress.. just pass it...do not waste your time. Unlike her peers, Sonakshi does not touch the feet of her coach, as her father forbids her to do so. Thakur ki ladki' elopes with a Muslim boy, after which the police torture the Muslim family. Sonakshi Sinha is a police officer but does not sit for the pooja despite being told by her mother, and moves on defiantly.The web series makes every effort to show that modern and successful Hindu youth do not believe in their religion and insult Devi Devta and culture. This series can definitely be passed. You have better options on OTT.\n",
      "Review 4041: Clearly visible Leftist propoganda with same old theme of Hindu is bad, upper cast is bad, family is bad, housewives are bad But Muslims are good lower cast is good being single is good and riding bike without helmet is good.Sonakshi sinha's acting is not impressive. Other actors are way better. Marwadi accent is chapari class ( I am marwadi so I know).Plot is as well not well written as there is no effort to solve suspense in the series and a single professor solves it just by asking some random questions to a two star police officer while three star police officer is fighting his wife.Director has not given two cents to making plot intersting as they were busy placing propoganda in series.\n",
      "Review 4042: Plot is gripping, the setup is apt as well - a state which has a historic skewed female ratio, girls are considered burden, because of demand of dowry, and above all, this is so much influenced by the caste factor. The only single blot and the miscast that jumps right out of screen is Sonakshi. Sonakshi isn't the actor she believes she is. She manages to carry just one single expression all along the series. Just one blank expression. I don't have any hate for her. But she utterly failed to grasp the whole character. She couldn't get into the role. She was still in that Akira girl mode, Whole story, screenplay and the rest of the cast were brilliant. Sonakshi wasn't the right choice. I'm sorry. You can give it a go for the rest of the good things.\n",
      "Review 4043: This webseries is an Anti-Hindu Propoganda. Which mainly defends the Love Jihad and says that it's just a two people love each but we all know that what is true what is not. This series is very biased in showing one religion as a victim in the society which is exactly opposite to what is actually happening. It even focus on dividing Hindus by showing caste discrimination at a very high peak and because of this I can firmly say that this series main aim is to Victimize a particular community and make other community bad and also focus on dividing Hindus by using caste game. Thus we can come to a conclusion that this web series is not good for peace and harmony of the society. So think twice before watching this as this is a waste of time.\n",
      "Review 4044: Started watching Dahaad and felt that it is one more webseries that is kind of concentrated on specific areas. Not a great screen play and of course, sonakshi's acting is average. As most of the directors and media never dare to talk about major problems in society, this webseries taken a minor issue of the larger problem and took advantage of it especially related to a specific religion.Story and screen play is ok but the Sonakshi would have been acted better. As we see many tv serial actors daily , I felt that she is one of the new actress in the webseries.Story would have been better and when you mention about any specific problem about society then makes sure that the role of that character is well defined.As usual, this media is not to consider as they are very biased.\n",
      "Review 4045: I am a white atheist Englishman. I do not pretend to understand the religions of India or the caste system and therefore apologise if people who appear to be offended by this series as being inaccurate on any of those issues think I am not qualified to review it. All I can do is to view it as a police procedural television presentation, and on that score I can tell you I found the program absolutely fantastic.The acting, the interplay of the characters of different backgrounds was excellent. The pacing, the unfolding of the story, the locations was superb. The editing and cinematography was amazing. I cannot recommend this highly enough and if you want to see an interesting and absorbing police drama without the glossy American clich√©s then check out this series.\n",
      "Review 4046: Sonakshi, gulshan and vijay did excellent work. They all lived their characters. Story was gripping and intense. A must watch series for suspense thriller lovers. Its not only focused on murder mystery but also throw light on some serious problems as caste system, discrimination, relationships. It shows what is the actual condition of our police force on or off duty. Sonakshi shines all through the series, her tone and body language was excellent. Award winning performance by vijay and sonakshi. Vijay is sweet and brutual at same time. Gulshan fits in every frame. Direction was tight and focused. Overall amazing üëè\n",
      "Review 4047: Dahaad delivers a gripping cop drama filled with stellar performances, touching upon vital social issues. It weaves together a captivating tale that keeps you hooked. With a stellar cast, Vijay Varma shines bright, and Sonakshi Sinha impresses, but it's Gulshan Devaiah's outstanding portrayal that steals the show. His heartfelt arguments with his wife on their daughter's freedom are truly unforgettable. The series hits the bullseye in portraying authentic police investigations. It's a crime suspense drama that keeps you at the edge of your seat, rather than a typical crime thriller. While Dahaad may not captivate everyone, it can be seen as slow-paced and overly pessimistic. Nevertheless, its depiction of the harsh realities of the world reflects a certain truth. Dahaad leaves a lasting impact, addressing gender inequality, caste discrimination, and crimes against women, and leaving you pondering long after the credits roll.\n",
      "Review 4048: This is better than most of the garbage Indian series out there. Story is gripping with some very good actors . The depiction of the serial killer is unique and transcends the cliched bloody and gruesome maniac. The screenplay could have been better.The depiction of the police work, Indian caste system and discrimination is well portrayed.

Just a good thriller series with the underlying message of the harsh societal reality still prevalent in many parts of India.\n",
      "Review 4049: This Indian series is very predictable, but also offers a fun watch because of the cat and mouse action. The casting is fine, but the caliber of acting does vary. The narrative unfolds in a very choppy and often disjointed manner, making story continuity for viewers slightly challenging. One is always having to fill in gaps that seem to be left out when trying to connect the dots. Events happen, but in a manner where the necessary context is just not provided.Since it takes place in Rajasthan, one might have expected to see a bit more of the culture, but very little of that was included. The caste system was not that well explained, and assumes that all viewers understand it. It was presented as if the producers were ashamed of the concept. The sex scenes are an integral part of the story, but are somewhat muted by western standards to get around censorship. Overall, it's watchable but also very predictable!\n",
      "Review 4050: Very shallow and boring. Doesn't deserve to be called web series. Mistakes of Taandav' is repeated. Story is blandly put without any suspense or thrill. Bollywood ppl should stick to their boring and cliche movies and leave web series. Just making video in a themed colour like brown or blue doesn't make web series special.I could watch only two episodes. Lot of propaganda and excess cast angle is shown. I understand there is caste discrimination India. But no constable will light agarbatti in police station after few cast ppl passes outside of his cabin. Also tried to whitewash love trap jihad as actual love.\n",
      "Review 4051: This thriller series will make you Bing watch it. In starting for couple of episodes, it felt boring and without any direction. But, the story peaks pace slowly and grips your attention. It's about a psycho killer who lives simple life and does his dirty job in spare time. The process of police investigation is much more realistic, logical and takes you on a thriller ride. The criminal is one step ahead of police making them believe otherwise. Sonakshi Sinha has done good acting which can be her comeback to the screens.I suggest you to must watch it.Amazon did great job like they did in past while making Hindi web series.\n",
      "Review 4052: If you are a leftist or a lierbandu or a sickular... then you will love this series.If you live in the real world then you will realize how messed up this web series is like the typical bollywood content which focuses on dissing one specific community all the time. I wish they had the guts to show the other community which is in the news 24/7 where there are so many crimes reported / identified but no action taken due to vote bank politics...There are so many other topics which can be shown but the bollywood chooses the same old anti- h!ndu content ... maybe its convenient for them and therefore they choose to put their entire energy in making these....\n",
      "Review 4053: If you get thru the 1st 2 Episodes, You will definitely be rewarded. It is undoubtedly the best work of Vijay Varma & Sonakshi Sinha till date. They are absolutely brilliant in the show.The story is phenomenal too. The cat and mouse game between Vijay & Sonakshi + Co is nothing but riveting. Even Gulshan Devaiah is so neat in the show. An absolute thriller true to the Genre.Loved every bit of it as it gets better as we go. The 1st Episode admittedly is a bit slow and a lot of people just give up after that. That could prove very costly in this case as this show just takes off after the Opening episode. So stay put and you won't regret it !!!!\n",
      "Review 4054: This is the same old story fed by commies, who keep abusing indian rituals. Always abuse hindus, promote love jihad, and promote one particular religion. Downgrade hindus and their rituals......Was not able to complete first episode.....that same old story is there.....Grow up reema you are not in 1970s....where this task of downgrading hindus on you......and sonakshi is biggest headache....with no expression and same face.....bright actors were underutilised,.....but main story is \"ghisa pita pitaara\"......amazon is loooooooosing its quality......just abusing one community and highlighting artificial casteism.......they consider they created something.....but they created only GARBAGE......anyway ...it seems this is like GARBAGE in GARBAGE out.......save your time and paracetamol......you can watch chhota bheem instead for this much time......\n",
      "Review 4055: This one is a typical story by leftist writers. The typical leftist dose of how upper caste exploit the lower caste. They will keep the issue burning by pitching one caste against the other. Also good effort is made to dismiss and whitewash Love Jihad. Not sure why they want to glorify life of women who don't get married and portray people who get married in a bad light. Other than this the story is well made but with heavy dose of leftist/liberal propoganda. Javed Akhtar is a active member of CPIM and his daughter is following his footsteps. I'm sure if you go through the profiles of other writers, it'll be a similar case.\n",
      "Review 4056: Sonakshi sinha is outstanding in this incredibly engaging and engrossing series that will tie you up in knots as twisted and encrypted as any the great escalators of suspense in the past could have done. Yet another example of the outstanding series the country of India produces, let it open a door to some of the best series you've never seen if this is your first foray into this part of the world. You will not be disappointed.The main character sonakshi sinha is totally banger as a cop. She is really an underated actress.Bgm is decent. And reema as a director show her creativity in the series.\n",
      "Review 4057: You know the villain from episode one, so there is no suspense around that. Despite that, it's cat and mouse chase thriller keeps you hooked. There are some obvious faults in story and direction, like excessive imp given to Sonakshi's character despite she shown as jr officer. The notable effort is from Vijay Verma in negative role, convinces you of serial killer attitude. The caste angle was also unnecessary and drags story offtrack from its plot. Sonakshi has done overacting in many scenes. Also, the plot shown is of Rajasthan but its not convincing enough without much local language use.Okay for binge watch one time, won't feel bored.\n",
      "Review 4058: Story is very weak , similar story you can see in kathal movie available on Netflix which is good written then this bullish.police knew that the girls had physical relationship with killer they are not going in hotels for inquiries, police also don't go to chemist shop for pregnancy pills inquiries also police had doubts on killer they are not serve lance him. And main point in this series is you can't get what the f character are thinking and why the f they are doing, you can't relate with any character in the series the characters of this series are very confused in their life and they confused us also, very talented actors are wasted in this series. I don't know what writer is thinking while writing this characters ,I waste my time please stay away from this.\n",
      "Review 4059: Its a good serial. Acting of all the casts is also good. But there is nothing like dahad. A lady inspector is doing her usual job like all other police. Nothing special. Just because a women is doing it does not mean it becomes special to be called as dahad. All are equal level employees. The story had been better had they not made it a secular story. Bashing upper caste Hindus and glorifying converted abrahamists and lower caste Hindus is called secularism in India. While glorifying Hindus especially upper castes is communalism. This web series from bollywood is again a secular web series to increase the trp and gain quick popularity. Plus it promotes love jihad.\n",
      "Review 4060: Please don't waste your time. It's not a thriller nothing is interesting you can predict the story from episode 1. There is agenda to glorify one community as bollywood does in It's maximum movies. Only the actor who is performing the serial killer has done good work in acting. Writing is not good and director has dragged the episodes which you feel after 2 episode. You can leave the series in between and can watch it after one month so you can understand what kind of thriller it would be. I think they forgot to add background music. Actors are trying to talk in local language but it's clearly shows they have not done practice.\n",
      "Review 4061: First of all I will start with the good things and unfortunately there aren't many. Acting (excluding Sonakshi) and cinematography are the only good things in this series. Rest it is just a story of a sloppy serial killer and even sloppier police force. The story had amazing scopes, however it is very under researched. Too many clues left by the killer and all the clues ignored by police. Just to catch him in a third state. It's trailer felt very promising with the storyline, however it's just waste of our time. Overall this series could be skipped without any doubt. I wasted my time, I hope the readers could save ther time.\n",
      "Review 4062: Other actors are good , v good theme , plot , story telling everything is good but chonakshi didn't fit in all this at all. I downgraded and asked friends and family not to waste there time on this after I barely finished first episode. Other series by same production was brilliant so expectations was high but this one disappointed. Chonakshi should join politics or be house wife instead she doesn't have Karishma what his dad carries. I could not continue after first episode as it didn't hold me there, they could instead cast uday Chopra in place of Sonakshi he would have done better expression or acting then Chonakshi.\n",
      "Review 4063: Really well made series. A breath of fresh air from all the superficial garbage out there. Loved the dialogues, the casting, the performances and the plot! Absolutely amazing. A must watch. Every Indian citizen needs to watch this gold, and internalized the issues addressed in it. Kudos to Sonakshi Sinha for such an amazing job, and Vijendra Verma is undoubtedly always the best actor on the block. Special mention to all other characters, utterly genuine performances. Loved each and every episode, and the thrill made it a binge to really watch in one go. No part was dull or boring so go ahead and watch it now!\n",
      "Review 4064: I started watching Dahaad without any expectations or background information. However, I got drawn into this well written and well acted web series from the very first episode. Although the central focus is on the meticulous work undertaken by the police to apprehend a serial killer, social issues of casteism and dowry and their consequences constitute a large part of the story. I liked the fact that the take- home messages were positive ones (i.e. There is more to a girl's life than marriage, that often the men in our lives are our biggest champions, and that the world still has a few good people left). The casting was spot-on which along with the good screenplay makes Dahaad a taut and interesting thriller. One criticism that I have is that the makeup of the leading cast members (male and female) was not realistic at all; their skin and hair looked perfect even after several all nighters and long bike rides. This is a small issue in the bigger scheme of things and overall this series is highly recommended.\n",
      "Review 4065: Indian OTT platforms have been flooded with content right now, but this little venture stands it's ground. Strong performances by everyone, not a single character seems out of palace. Nothing over the top, but everything fits like pieces of a puzzle. Desert background is a nice touch. Every character seems natural, no fake accents and no unnatural dialogue delivery. Sonakshi is an underrated actress, she always is graceful to watch. Gulshan is always at ease on the screen. But Vijay Verma steals the limelight. He's has proven his versatility again. The way he has portrayed his character, is a treat for eyes. Lastly the Indian social system has been portrayed accurately in the series with clear social messages. We need such series and content to watch, would definitely like to see the characters on another venture in a sequel...!!\n",
      "Review 4066: Story of a village in Rajasthan where a man had killed 27 women. It is based on cat and mouse chasing which Will not let you feel bore . Reema's direction is one of the best part of it. Bgm is also decent.Personally I feel it is one of the best performance of Sonakshi Sinha. We have seen her powerful acting in lootera and akira , and here she is just like that.her ascend is not brilliant but good.she has used her real potential.Vijay as a villain is also good .his dark performance not let you feel bore. And other actors also justified in their screen presence.I totally loved the series. Must watch.\n",

      "Review 4068: A main lead Sonakshi come from a lower caste and had hate for upper caste in her mind. Caste drama. Actress has a casual relationship like she is in 2050 but the caste system they are showing like they are in 1850. Defaming Rajasthan and specially the upper caste and jat. COP got a serial killer case snd predicted the killer caste in first episode that killer must be from upper caste and actually found it same. Hateful content.Poor storyline but the vijay verma is really did his best. Everyone in police station including her just senior and the district commissioner ( both married) level person has crush on this cop. Frustrating dialogues and cheap mentality. I watched it full just because of vijay verma he made it watchable.\n",
      "Review 4069: The way the harsh-reality of social inequality has been weaved into the storyline is just PERFECT ! This is my first-ever Imdb review (even though I've been an avid user of the site for over 2 decades now) and I've registered on the site just to write this review. Only Sonakshi could've done justice to the main role and she does that quite effortlessly. Watch it for Sonakshi, for without her intensity this gem of a series would have been a total lackluster disaster. Vijay's acting complements the dashing and daring performance of Sonakshi in quite an important way. Having said that, it is Sonakshi who is the show-stealer, all the way !\n",
      "Review 4070: Dahaad keeps you engaged in spite of its slow pace and running time. Thanks to the effective storytelling by the directors Reema Kagti and Ruchika Oberoi. I just wished this investigation drama had more of the backstory that gave birth to such a psychopath.The casting is top notch here with brilliant performances across the board. Vijay Varma steals the show with his cold blooded act. Gulshan Devaiah and Sohum Shah are terrific. It was great to see Sonakshi Sinha coming to her own smashing casteism and patriarchy. All the other supporting actors shine in their roles.Overall enjoyed a show after a long time. Prime Video has another winner in their hands.\n",
      "Review 4071: Sonakshi Sinha as a police officer has a good future. Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar has created a good series commenting on the social differences, policing, women in police force, male supremacy,caste differences and their impact and other such issues prevalent in rural parts of India and which also leads to the crime shown in the film.Vijay Verma is the character you will love to hate for the way he has portrayed his role. I wish the killer's identity would have been revealed to the audience later or the story should not be stretched to as many episodes.But overall its a good watch for Sonakshi, Gulshan, Soham, Vijay and the story and direction.\n",
      "Review 4072: Speechless. Brillient performance by sonakshi sinha and vijay varma . Sonakshi sinha has fade the boys by her powerful performance.she is looking great as a woman cop. This series is also giving a strong message for girls in India. Lets hope it sends out a strong message to bring about a change and we get to read the same news in our daily newspapers as shown in the final scene...The message spoken through this movie is a real need of the hour. I definitely recommend watching this !Even if there are any mistakes in the making of the series that can be overlooked by the overall outcome...üëèüëèüëç\n",
      "Review 4073: First of the show is too slow and add to it the fake accent trying to imitate or make fun of culture.very bad acting bad storyline...worth skipping.Not sure what was the need to make such a series trying to create fear among people with a false narrative and false stories that dont exist. Real life stories that inspire the public are more intriguing and more calming for the public. There has to be censor board to audit series also. Very disappointing with the story which is false and trying to scare the public with imaginary false depiction of a certain community. Rajastan is a very beautiful place and people there have great regard for their culture.\n",
      "Review 4074: I was surprised at how good the show was which I binge watched in 1 night. Hats off to the directors for so maturely handling the issues of caste, religion, porn etc. Kudos to Sonakshi, Vijay, Gulshan and the rest of the crew for their stellar performance. It was such a thrilling, fun and entertaining show. The twists and turns in the show kept me glued to the seat.It is amazing how much hatred there exists in India for women, unmarried women, working women, poor people, people of different castes and religions and so forth. And there is such an obsession for marriage and proceation. Simply astounding.\n",
      "Review 4075: Wow! What a series! Finally a good movie has been released in a while. The direction is splendid I must say. Whether it be the shots, the emotions or anything else...it was on spot. Also considering the fact that everything is on point. Even the start, directly starts on point. The trailer itself had me waiting for the movie. It is definitely a great gripping series. It is fast and has a good plot, climax and story. So if you're looking for a story you can watch as a family.....THIS IS PERFECT! (It does have some swear words though)Sonakshi sinha's acting is wonderful. Wow, her expressions clearly convey the thrill.The message spoken through this series is a real need of the hour.I definitely recommend watching this.\n",
      "Review 4076: The story of this serisl is excellant. The story unfolds very smoothly and the entire team as worked very nicely.Two things I felt can be improved1 The police team and search process are very ordinary and lacklustre2 Like all ordinary serials private life of policeman is shown which is unnecessary. It will impact anybody who is trying to get in to police jobIt could have become very interesting if little strong characters were included in Police team which seems very ordinary.Overall good entertaining serial , which could have become extraordinary. In my opinion good story was not utilised properly.\n",
      "Review 4077: But social evils breed queer morals - did not understand why there was an anti-marriage narrative which is just pathetic and sad as society these days cannot think for themselves anyway and marred eternally by the social evils existing in it.Also working 24/7 is glorified which is one of the social evils in itself.The plot itself manages painfully to pass the kindergarten examination of a serial killer plot.I guess it was made watchable by the amazing restraint shown by the writer to avoid obscene language, by Sonakshi Sinha who gives the star presence and general faultless performance of all the actors.\n",
      "Review 4078: Great series, everyone must go and watch it once. My salute to all for the way the thrilling story of the series has been portrayed. Spectacular and gripping thriller that will keep you glued to your seat till the end. It takes some time in the beginning but after that the whole story will leave you stunned. A very strong message has been given in the series for our society. The last two episode of the series will make you thrill and make you think . Sonakshi sinha this time her brilliant performance has surprised me. She is indeed a versatile actress. And he has played his character well. Rest of the actors have also done a great job in the series. Highly recommended that you all must watch this it once, I can say that you will not be disappointed after watching. We want more like itAnd No Doubt that sonakshi sinha is a far better than other actresses she's has proved it again with her splendid performancetake a bow to herüôèüôåI Give this movie for sonakshi sinha Magnificent performance 5 out of 5 ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n",
      "Review 4079: Dahaad is a nice interesting series showwing police case investigation story about a masss murder mystery. Police are trying to solve the case and find the criminal. I liked the suspense element created in the story and I also liked the intense scenes of crime created in the story. A lot of suspense awaits when you dont know who the criminal is. The criminal looks innocent by face but by deeds he is far more than a criminal. Will the police be able to trace the location of the criminal and give him punishment we must watch the series to know about it. I loved the story of this series. I loved the acting of all the actors in the series specially SOnakshi Sinha, Gulshan Devaiah and Vijay Verma and Sohum Shah. I recommed you to watch the series. This series episodes though they are of one hour duration will never bore you but wll excite you more. I rate Dahaad series 10 stars on 10. I also liked the locations and the music of this series. Must watch.\n",
      "Review 4080: The first season of the \"Dahaad\" series delivers impeccable acting that feels incredibly genuine. The actors bring the characters to life so convincingly that you forget you're watching a work of fiction. The direction is awesome, skillfully delving into sensitive subjects like caste and showcasing the nuances of good parenting. Sonakshi Sinha delivers her best performance to date, effortlessly fitting into her character. The rest of the cast, including Vijay Verma, Gulshan Devaiah, and Sohum Singh, are undeniably talented and skilled actors. While the story may seem a bit stretched after the suspense of the killer's identity is revealed, this attention to detail can also be seen as a con. The series strives to maintain a realistic approach, avoiding any rushed conclusions. Overall, \"Dahaad\" is a remarkable watch, and kudos to the entire team. I didn't anticipate enjoying it so much, but I ended up binge-watching all the episodes in one night. Sonakshi's performance was a delightful surprise; this series has transformed her from a heroine into a remarkable actor in my eyes.\n",
      "Review 4081: I recently wasted my time watching this series Dahaad and I have to say, it was a complete waste of time.The storyline was confusing and poorly executed, leaving me feeling lost and uninterested throughout the entire series. The acting was subpar at best, with wooden performances and lack of emotion from the cast. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or development, making it impossible to connect with them on any level.Overall, I would not recommend this series to anyone looking for a quality viewing experience. Save yourself the time and skip this one.There are much better options out there.\n",
      "Review 4082: The story is perfect to learn in depth about the psyche of each n every aspect of the Indian society,be it negative or positive, though less .It progresses smoothly and builds the excitement about what NEXT. Specifically marvelous picturisation of the psycho killer... alongwith very well portrayed aspects of the Indian society - caste discrimination even after almost 75 years ,politics and religion, gender discrimination,evolution of the police investigative methods than in the past ,changing culture n society and much more. VV - the serial killer and backward SI in the police force are the mainstay of the whole series.\n",
      "Review 4083: Fabulous acting by Sonakshi and even whole team ! Much watch seriesA bit slow means story had been stretched more .But story plot and suspense will lead you to complete whole series in a go .Vijay verma as the psychopath Anand swarnakar done his role phenomenol.people who love crime shows will definitely love it .As I had listen about cyanide mohan in news article quite few years ago that leads me to watch this series ,whole series is based on him .Mind set of psychopath ,why he is doing it , and the outcome ,and even how you can save your self from such act is presented so good. Thanks.\n",
      "Review 4084: For those of you who enjoy British police/detective series and miniseries, this is for you. This series is based essentially on real time serial killer, Mohan Kumar.There are eight episodes. Even though this isn't a fast paced, action-packed series, it is an intense, well written, well-acted series. A great slow burner. The acting is exceptional, with lead actress Sonakshi Sinha doing an incredible job. All the supporting actors also do a great job.Production values are excellent, along with cinematography. I watched this series in one day, giving up my normal pickleball evening. IMO, it is that good. You do know who the bad guy is in the beginning, so it is not a whodunit, but a when will they catch him. Lots of twists and turns to keep you interested.Thank you for your time.\n",
      "Review 4085: I would like to say well done sonakshi and the entire team. All the dots were well connected and very nice natural scenes. Villain was excellent.Amazed to see some low ratings but i would say that it is one of the best serial killer movie. Very complex to adapt the local rajisthani language. Well done all the actors. It was not just simple cat and mouse chase. This series is having a message for girls education and to support them. Apart from really good suspense, the movie went inside some of the internal life giving a message about domestic problems which women face.Waiting for the second season. Come up with some new story may be some other crime story.\n",
      "Review 4086: Wow. Seriously didn't knew Sonakshi Sinha could act so well. The story, pacing of it and the way it was shown was so engaging and exciting that it kept me glued to the screen the whole time. Whenever Vijay Sharma came on screen all eyes were on him, his performance is on another level. Although all the side characters had good dialogues and were not neglected. One police officer had a sweet wholesome side arc which showed his growth in a beautiful way. Overall a great one time watch about a gruesome murder thriller case which is based upon real events (does really shocks you when you read about it in times of India).Obviously it has flaws like the finale seemed streched, sometimes the screen went too dark and was unable to see stuff happening. No piece of art is perfect, but still I can open heartily recommend it.\n",
      "Review 4087: It's a long series, but very engaging. The main actors - Sonakshi, Vijay Verma, Gulshan D, Soham Shah are all very good. However i feel the actor Gulshan D was underutilized since i have seen him to be a fantastic actor. Vijay Verma seems to fit the character so well. First time I've seen Soham Shah and liked him. Sonakshi looks fit and gets the bulk of the footage. The storyline is very detailed and may sometimes feel dragging. Since the audience can see what Vijay Verma is upto at each stage, it may seem that initially that the cops are not competent enough to identify the culprit, but then.... Want to see more series like this. The episodes are nearly an hour long and 8 episodes make it a long watch. Nevertheless must watch!!\n",
      "Review 4088: As such I had never liked Sonakshi sinha in any commercial movie but this series has changed my perception about her acting skills. The dialect was just unmatchable , not many actors have been able to match this perfection in dialect . Vijay Varma - he is toh out of world as always. He is an impeccable actor and in a big league of great actors (the so called stars cannot come close to the finesse of Vijay). The series is an edge of seat thriller, great direction. I loved the character played by Gulshan- great acting with a subtlety , loved every scene . Great acting by Sohum shah. All in all A Must Watch Series !\n",
      "Review 4089: The series was really good. This type of series are the evidence of a woman/girl is treated in India. After so many changes in the world still there is no respect or empathy for woman.The sole reason he was killing the girls is very stupid. In that way, we should kill every man who flirts with girls.The series is a must watch. To see how investigation is carried out is very thrilling and also how they catch him.Sonakshi acting was good. I really don't think it was bad this time. Also Vijay's acting was fabulous as usual. The directors did a very good jog, they portrayed how India is failing its daughters.\n",
      "Review 4090: Just finished watching dahaad on Amazon prime. Must watch series...Vijay and Gulshan is always outstanding but this time Sonakshi nailed it. This is Sonakshi's career best performance. A thriller series in which a serial killer kills women the second day after the marriage. Psycho killer is well played by Vijay and Sonakshi is the main cop. Sonakshi is portraying role of a strong independen women who is very smart and intelligent at the same time. There are total 8 episodes but each episode will set you to the edge of your seat. Giving it 8 star. I hope in future we can get to see Sonakshi in more web series like this.\n",
      "Review 4091: Dahaad is a serial killer story set in rajistan India.The story is captivating in the start but the bad casting could not save the plot.The biggest problem is Sonakshi Sinha in the series as her performance is total cringe in the series. Her facial expressions, her dialogues each and everything is lowest level of acting. She just does not fit in the role in any way possible.If only the lead actress was better and only 6 episodes were premiered. The series would have been way better. The last 2 episodes are totaly stretched and unnecessary!I have never given such low rating to any series till now. For me 4/10.\n",
      "Review 4092: I and my wife binge watched this series in one day. The plot was superb. The direction was amazing and the storyline was mostly gripping. However, the aftertaste was not equally good, thereby leaving scope for improvement in patches. One thing I did not like much was that the smaller stories did not get much outcome even though they consumed a lot of time. The story of Gulshan's wife and family comes to mind. Situations were built between him and his wife, but with no logical conclusion. Sonakshi's mother just has an annoying role without adding much to the story. It would have been nice if to story of Vijay's wife was opened a bit more. Maybe in the next season?\n",
      "Review 4093: The only reason I'm rating this show 6 is Sonakshi's overacting.Except Sonakshi almost everything up to the markSonakshi should learn how to adapt the role The only reason I'm rating this show 6 is Sonakshi's overacting.Except Sonakshi almost everything up to the markSonakshi should learn how to adapt the role The only reason I'm rating this show 6 is Sonakshi's overacting.Except Sonakshi almost everything up to the markSonakshi should learn how to adapt the role The only reason I'm rating this show 6 is Sonakshi's overacting.Except Sonakshi almost everything up to the markSonakshi should learn how to adapt the role.\n",
      "Review 4094: Saving grace of the series is the super acting by vijay verma, Sonakshi is very loud, terrible acting, irritating (unbearable) and it comes with the anti hindu propoganda of the caste factor & how love jihad is a farce & only hindus are overreacting & muslims are the poor, decent people are being targeted... will this bollywood never learn...?? The writers seem to be interested in the caste system, when India is growing towards new heights, these people want to pull it down with this cheap stories...the cast is ok, with sonakshi with her rude over the top acting is the only negative...would have loved shefali shah doing this role or for that matter anyone else...\n",
      "Review 4095: Most crime investigation drama series are structured in such a way that the final episodes typically contain the \"big reveal\" where the killer is unmasked but Dahad takes a journey away from the beaten track by trying a fresh if not totally new approach.Vijay Varma as Anand Swarnakar, who potrays the \"cool as cucumber\" and \"cunning as a fox\" serial killer has performed a memorable role that is sure to keep him etched in the minds of anyone and everyone who watched \"Dahad\". All the characters together have delivered great performances and keeps you riveted to the screen even though each episode is approx 60 minutes long. Definitely recommended for people who like \"slow burn\" crime dramas.\n",
      "Review 4096: I rated Dahaad (2023) 2/10the only reason for this rating is because of Dark theme of the screen, most of the movie is shot where the screen is extremely dark, the characters are not clearly visible, i am not sure if this is a technical flaw or done wantedly by movie makers, The on screen experience is highly disappointing. I am extremely disappointed. It appears as if we are watching a drama but it's a sort of blank scenes and experience as such is as if we are actually listening to a story on Radio, It's not a movie experience, i am not sure if OTT platforms are always so dull and lighting is so poor that hardly any charecters are visible. Hope the movie makers review their policy and meet the expectations of a viewer, Present experience is like watching an age old movie whose reel has become outdated and not fit or rather not watchable. I think even old reels are better projected, Sorry i have to say this because watching it makes your eyes sore. It defeats the purpose of a movie watching experience .\n",
      "Review 4097: I am not sure why people are giving poor ratings to this excellent series. It gives an excellent representation of the age old issues facing in our country even today. I know few people will be unhappy with the fact shown in the series with the assumption that our country is doing very well in multiple sectors and we are doing great in multiple sectors. Which is definitely true, but we also need to acknowledge that caste and gender related issues are still very much prevalent in India even today.The only negative I feel, is just like many have already mentioned here. The makers seems to show a bias towards one community. Most of the good policemen and people are from one community and all baddies are from the other community. There should be a more neutral way of representing.\n",
      "Review 4098: What a drama shows so much reality for the corrupt Indian government giving priority on basis of caste and religion. Framing the innocents and superb acting and thriller content from zoya Akhtar. Great job Vijay and Sonakshi you guys rocked.Coming to story brilliant storyline and screenplay and editing was just superb l. No moment you'll be bored or feel it's dragging. It shows how psychopaths think they don't care about their relationship and are so desperate they think way beyond expectations.I simply loved it it wouldn't hurt to say it was as good or may be better than dexter at least for this season.\n",
      "Review 4099: This is a must watch show which is based on the Police and Serial killer Drama which is shown amazingly, but the best part of the show is that it show's us the Harsh reality of our society, the caste system(how so called upper caste people treats Lower castes people) , gender inequality( how men and in mostly cases women too treats other women or their own daughters or sisters), Dowry system(how because of it women's, many times,had to face lifetime issues, how it families think of their daughters as burden to them) , etc.A big thums up and thank you to the makers of the show. Really Guys it is a Good and must watch show.\n",
      "Review 4100: Loved Sonakshi, she did good justice to her role. Very convincing as police officer. Story was good and engaging not a great star cast but main 2 lead roles were absolutely convincing. Worth a watch. No where now where I felt agnihotri's comment that Sonakshi was not convincing as a police officer because she look very decent and the other villain is also very very convincing as the negative character and other rules where well done not a great star cast and over all its great watch refreshing and a good justice was done definitely I like the way they have maintain the balance of the two community which days filmmakers only for hatred for they have shown a good harmonium balance it is generally true.\n",
      "Review 4101: Series with amazing acting , cast, direction will keep you hooked up throughout all episodes. Characters are well defined. The series gives you a complete range of experience where Vijay Varma's passive aggressiveness would scare you from core, Gulshan Devaiah who is modern day good man would keep your believe in humanity, Sonakshi Sinha would bring a spark in all struggling common women. Other grey characters such as Sohum Shah & Zoa Morani would make you feel empathetic. Most importantly the series focused on each character even though the thumbnail only has Sonakshi Sinha. Kudos to creators and entire cast..a must watch for everyone who likes crime genre.\n",
      "Review 4102: Over all trailer looks fine,but it is almost matches with kerala story but bit story different .Nice video graphy dialog are ok but still some thing missing feel some more interesting and curious can included in the movie. Sonakshi is pretty but not look like police officer range more active was required. A series of murder happened in one place if it is in various place then it would more curious & interesting as wellOver all trailer is ok ok but how people reacts on this no idea. To be frank I am not much great fan of sonakshi. Looks like story some thing interesting need to watch movie.all the best.\n",
      "Review 4103: Plot, storyline, cinematography, dialogues, background music and every cast is perfect excepting sonakshi. I never saw a police girl with everytime perfect look with make up. She carries a emotionless face too which doesn't go well with the character she portrays, rest kudos to everyone of the team member for this fantabulous work.Vijay verma made another benchmark performance in his career by choosing this character.Vijay verma made another benchmark performance in his career by choosing this character.Vijay verma made another benchmark performance in his career by choosing this character.\n",
      "Review 4104: This may be one of the few series where cops have never even raised their hands on any of the suspects or criminals. The series focuses heavily on the crime rather than the punishment rendered for such crimes. I feel Rajasthan police have been given a raw deal here. They have been portrayed as rather soft and subdued. There are couple of episodes with Sonakshi learning kick boxing only for climbing walls of her boyfriend's terrace. The fitness was only for that I suppose... Gulshan Devaiah for once has played a clean role and again a very peaceful police officer. Overall a decent watch. I really feel it could've been shortened by 2 episodes. Looking forward to season 2.\n",
      "Review 4105: Good thriller , excellent acting by each character, great direction ! Web series doing better than movies because public has evolved and are more educated to fall for nonsense like fake vfx effects , unpractical action scenes hanging in between helicopters and not dying despite 100 bullets . Those days are gone . We want realistic movies depicting real life stories that people can relate to. Lite comedies , suspense , thrillers provide entertainment. There is already unrest, war, stress and crises in life , pls don't create more mental agony.Dahaad will grip you in your seat for sure ! Guarantee.\n",
      "Review 4106: All episodes were good. But bit stretched. N feel the murdered of 29 women was not punshied eight nor given the proper eeason behind his acted.. he just said 3 lines at d end and sonakshi went away. Police didn't even bit him single time. They should beat him mercilessly... director should show sum cruel act against that murderer. Itni mahenat se 8 episodes dekhne ke baad jaise kuchh mila nahi. In short ending is too weak. Delhi crime was best as they had shown hatred against that criminal. Didhdiebdi rjxo kej. Ej jeu Jr dieioe. Eidd9dn. Eo ii. Ei. E s. Iekkckeoejc d endkekdk ndjci hdj udj uej9 jdj.\n",
      "Review 4107: Dahaad begins with an interesting premise of chasing a serial killer by a police team led by SI Anjali Bhati. The series, however, foreground many social evils existing in the society of hinterland.What makes this series special is the performance of Sonakshi Sinha as the female protagonist Anjali Bhati. Sonakshi absolutely fits into the role of a badass female police officer who completely immerses herself into the case.Vijay Varma also finds a complex and despicable character to play and he renders it perfectly. Gulshan Devaiah and Sohum Shah's characters are also well drawn.What pulls this series back is the sluggish nature of the narrative that should have been compressed into four episodes instead of eight.\n",
      "Review 4108: Vijay Varma has ticked all boxes along with Sohum Shah who has not that elaborate role. Gulshan is already well known for whatever role he takes on. I bet he could have given another paradigm if he was the villain. Sonakshi does a good job too. The message this show wants to deliver about women empowerment also comes out as desired. There are also good time given to the cast's character development and side stories.The only complain is the last part where things are feeling like a bit rushed but still manageable. I would urge people to watch this and have a different flavor of the crime thriller.\n",
      "Review 4109: Been a fan of Sonakshi since Lootera and with Dahaad she has once again proved what she's capable of. Anjali Bhaati was written for her and she pulled it off effortlessly.Vijay Varma is stellar once again, the guy just doesn't disappoint. Gulshan as usual was wonderful too but could've been utilised better. The last scene in particular will stay with me for a long time. Special mention to the show's background score.In short, Dahaad for me is a WINNER.Kudos to Reema and Zoya for giving us another gem after Made in Heaven. The duo knows what they're doing & I'm so glad OTT is letting them tell such stories.\n",
      "Review 4110: One expects only the best from Zoya Akhtar and Reem Kagti and the series does come upto the mark.....however, one big issue seems to be that it doesn't seem to end....and who writes letters in this time and age....otherwise a very gripping series....worth the time!...they could have reduced it by two episodes easily...handled all issues like caste based discrimination, status of women very sensitively.... Sonakshi, Gulshan and the other performances are good too.... I would still recommend if very heavily to everybody....as a genre it seems to be new for Zoya/Reema but still the treatment is satisfactory!...\n",
      "Review 4111: Firstly good casting for every role. And everybody have given their best. Very nice story and neatly presented to audience as it get gels along nicely. And provide that extra mirchi masala wherever required.Even after knowing the main villain it holds the audiences to their seats. In this series one can make a note of how much sonakshi sinha had improved her acting skills.Overall, a Must watch material for every age group audience. And last but not the least nice direction as well. So DAHAAD has all qualities to becomeBIG- PAHAAD.Waiting for the next one, so as to witness classic direction/ acting/Story. Loved It.\n",

      "Review 4114: Sonakshi is Kayasth from her father side and Sindhi from her mother side. She dared to play the role of Dalit woman who is an Inspector posted in the Casteist belt of Rajasthan where most of the atrocities takes place against Dalit.Zoya And Reema Ji team have again won the heart and proved that such social drama can be portrayed beautifully without compromising the entertainment.Other Co Star have also given their heart out and made it the best series.Very few people in this country are concerned about the lives and misery of the Dalit's. I am touched that some one do really care other than us about our helplessness.\n",
      "Review 4115: There is no story in this series.... Some of the scenes are so illogical and stupid that goes beyond anyone's logic. This series is only dedicated to dimple Kapadia with all other actors as supporting roles for no reason. Nothing great about the series only except it's background music. Indian Villager women's shown as trained assassins with state of the art ammos. Lots of loose ends and confusion. It's difficult to understand why there are too many characters. Star cast is very weak and it seems this series is made for one character and rest are just nothing. Yes they have added some lustful scenes.\n",

      "Review 4118: The story line is somewhat expected much similar to Bollywood. Most of the cast has acted well and has given out one of their best performances. Couple like Radhika Madan are just for vulgarity with zero acting skills on the show, them absent doesn't change a thing.Naseer sahab, Dimple man and the rest have acted fab however the story line is very weak and can be preempted. The fact that you have to show sex and lesbians on the show to gain traction implies a weak story line.On the length of each episodes, they have unnecessary dragged it. It could have been a 6 episode series with a better climax.Would recommend viewers not to waste their time.\n",
      "Review 4119: After the initial 2 episodes, the plot just looses grip and goes downhill.

The worst of it is the police who's trying to be funny with the straight face expression all the time.Somewhere it's quite evident that these characters don't speak the language and they are unable to convey the emotions as a result.Harisssss is the only character who's somewhat likeable with a decent performance. Even Deepak Dobriyal fails to create the aura of a dark character by his portrayal of monk!Please don't make another season!\n",

      "Review 4313: The biggest issue with this eight-episode series is the lack of consistency, which leads to confusion in the plot, characters, and sequences. The character development throughout the series is poor, making it difficult to connect with any of the characters by the end. The visuals and editing can be disturbing, especially when the screen content is presented in a dim or dark light. The cast, including Dimple Kapadia and Radhika Madan, doesn't shine in their roles, with limited expressions and unexplored characters. The writing lacks memorable dialogues, except for one line. The series falls into the pattern seen in many Indian long-format content, with specific character archetypes. The only positive aspect is that it concludes on the eighth episode, with an average episode duration of 45-47 minutes. The character portrayed by Deepak Dobriyal is forgettable, as it doesn't offer much.\n",
      "Review 4314: I had high hopes with it, but felt empty after watching this series. Nothing compelling about this web series. On a name of women empowerment this show sucks. Very poor screenplay and depth in storyline. Writing and direction was really messy and that makes actors job more difficult especially Deepak Dobriyal. His character lacks the depth which require and has nothing compelling to do on screen. I wish they kept it more realistic like breaking bad and narcos.

Lots of originality.Acting: Quite good, even though accents are all over the place. Leads do justice when they are on screen.Cinematography and visuals: Very well shot, really bring out the colours of the desert setting. Costumes are a bit over the top to go with the grittiness of the narrative, but everything looks great.\n",
      "Review 4316: Excepting Radhika Madan (Shanta), every actor played their role perfectly. She didnt have a clear speech nor any changing expression on her face. Was struggling to understand what she was saying the whole time unlike the other actors who had a clearer delivery. Unsure if it was a choice for the character ?? Clearly not expectedBasic story line about the selection of heir from a bunch of choices but with good twists and plot. Lot of blood and gore. All the Makeup , clothing choices, sets were done really well. Wishing for a season 2 soon. Dimple Kapadia is an all time favorite üòç who can make this a huge success.\n",
      "Review 4317: Binge watched the series and I can surely say BB will do wonders if he get chance in future. He can do so much more than just comedy. I hope he gets all the things he want as he's already done with losing. Don't want to say BB is underrated after 5-10 years from now.Now let's talk about series, It started all good and takes it times to introduce all the characters however it feels like rushing towards the conclusion in mid episodes. Surely wanted each episode to be around 40mins at least, that would help to keep us engaging till end. After episode 3 everything seems to be going it boom... this.... and than.... Still it's a great series to watch.Note: This is my 1st review.\n",
      "Review 4318: As soon as the web series was over, I felt this enormous weight fall over me. It experiences a great deal of suffering, and the path to happiness is difficult. The entire cast and crew of this web series deserves praise for creating such a masterpiece. You all should watch this lovely presentation, is the only thing I want to say. Exceptionally well done! Everything: the script, the audio, the acting, the camera work, etc. Awesome! I agree that there were a few errors here and there, but I am writing this favorable evaluation because I saw believability features in this web series rather than flaws.Love You Bhuvan Bhai.\n",
      "Review 4319: To be honest, I came with little expectation from the series considering it to be his first venture! Apart from Bhuvan's promising acting, the concept seemed really intriguing. Anyways the acting, characters and storyline caught me offguard. Although, I felt things were a little rushed, but considering the risk of making an hour episode, it's justified. I won't say it's an alltime perfect show, but really good for someone who is making a hotstar level web series for the 1st time, and am pretty sure that the next season will be only better! Also, the cliffhanger towards the end was cherry on top!\n",
      "Review 4320: I just completed this series and I am shocked how brilliant this series was, I actually didn't expect this series to be this amazing and first of all the background music in this show was amazing and some songs used in between were also very nice and the whole cast acted well but bhuvan bam was the main highlight of the series, he was just amazing in every frame, I knew his acting was good but didn't know that was this amazing and story of this series was pretty decent, it's not like there were many twists in it but it was a decent story of rags to riches and this series totally deserves to be watched.\n",
      "Review 4321: The show was too good with their character , the story is not new but it keeps you girpped through out the show , the acting was amazing.It was a good family drama except some scenes the role played by bhuvan bam was amazing , it is like a fairy tail that you can see the future through your smart phone . India need these type of fils to revive BollywoodSuch a master class script writing and castingNo nepotism involved only talent talks in this show every middle class boy can relate to this show . Binged wat hed all the episode no use of nudity . One of the best comedy fictions story in a long long time.\n",
      "Review 4322: The storyline is so interesting that you won't even feel the length of the series. It has total 6 episodes. Bhuvan Bam's expressions, acting, dialogues was on point. Other actors & actresses executed their part really well. I'm strongly recommending this to everyone. Just wow!!The plot seems so real & authentic. It feels like I'm watching myself on the screen. I would suggest everyone to binge watch this series because the whole series is of 3 hours only. The technical aspect was also on point. The lighting, script, everything was so perfect. It is so much better than most bollywood movies. I mean it.\n",
      "Review 4323: This is Bhuvan Bam's series. Script is written for him, and ofcourse his out-of-confort-zone attempt and appropriate acting must be acknowledged. Other actors also given their best.But, the script is average and predictable. Common man s leap to become rich, afterwards his high-ego attitude, loosing the loved ones, and finally self-realization is not something we are seeing new. Ending looks like forced. As if, incidents are just happening to close the drama. Scriptwriter should have taken care of this part.Overall, Bhuvan Bam's fan can watch this, but to a person, who looks for new content every time, it's not recommended.\n",

      "Review 4325: The story and unique concept is its specialty, the lightings are far better than Dhindora. Actors(especially BB) have done there best and it is difficult to trace errors. Dialogues are heart touching and Vasant Gawde is very relatable to everyone, it seems that this series is made for the mass audience who relates to the character.Everything was good but the story could have been more detailed, it moves at a very fast pace. The twist in the final episode is predictable and does not create an impact as large as it should.Overall the series is very good and must watch for everyone. BB, this is gonna open your doors to Bollywood.\n",
      "Review 4326: The plot features repeated drama of bollywood. One love story, one villain but with a twist at the ending note (different from rhetoric). Bhuvan Bam is an extraordinary actor with superb series like Dhindora. But this one landed just below expectations. Nevertheless the direction is good and ofcourse 10/10 for acting. The picturisation of the pain in lives of the characters is also very close to reality.Good Things:1 Wonderful characters2 superb actingNot so good things:1 Predictable plot2 Less suspense and twists3 Typical hindi drama style (mostly)4 series also go slow sometimes.Finally hats off to Bhuvan bam for working so hard on the project. Eagerly waiting for the next:)\n",
      "Review 4327: I never reviewed in the past but since it's bhuvan who made this. I came running here to write one about it.I have been a fan of bhuvan for years so I would be completely biased with my review. I genuinely loved it. If you are a fan of BB i would completely recommend it. Although I won't deny that normal viewers might not like it. Not me though.I wouldn't compare it to other web series like family man as that is far better but it still places a special role within my heart.The only dissatisfaction I had was about hotstar which provided me with repeated ads. That was honestly annoying. That's it bye.\n",
      "Review 4328: Dhindora was fantastic...but this is underpar, story writing in between was very slow and stretched out...charater building is good, but most of the character do not even get that much screen time...

      "Review 4329: Just finished watching this webseries, I love & serformance gajab can't explain this series in words...just love it. BB is amazing. He is the best comedian. And how efficiently he does all the roles himself.A good-for-nothing boy from the lower middle-class strata of Mumbai gets a boon just around his 25th birthday. He can see the future and he decides to use it to earn big. But with time the power turns into a curse as it starts playing with his head and turns him into a demon he always feared. The first episode introduces us to the helplessness of everyone on the main team. There is an ambition to rise above but no means.\n",
      "Review 4330: I am from Bangladesh..Huge respect to Bhuvan Bam and his whole team..I watched taza khabar and really enjoyed so much and what a acting...Masterpiece...Watched it 2:30 am to 6 am and i relly liked all of the cast acting and direction....Really a apriciatable work...And bhuvan bam is a gem... Really a talented guy and show his virtually on this taza khabar series.. Hopefully it will be a blockbuster series so far....And if you guys didn't watch taza khabar... Must watch and share your experience...I am so glad to be a bb ki vines viewer....BB is really a gem...Love you from Bangladesh...\n",
      "Review 4331: Alluring....the first half was quite promising and the second half was quite predictable but we all know it is the 2nd webseries for Bhuvan bam in cinema industry , we all know his capabilities, he did his part beautifully. A actor from nowhere , better than so called star kids . Also credits to other 2-3 best actors . The series totally revolved around our favourite Bhuvan Bam and visually this show is brilliant . I wanted to give it 8 star but for Bhuvan , i will give it 2 star extra because he needs our support to stand in that so called Bollywood industry and I know he can do better and bigger impact on our cinema industry .. Thank you.\n",
      "Review 4332: Rags to riches is one such genre which gives you so many opportunities to hit the right strings. Taaza Khabar is one such opportunity which is wasted. This is one such mini series could have been muc better. First 2 episodes gels you to the couch however in the 3rd episode things start to get pretentious and boring. Too much of upload in 20-25 mins of episodes. It should have been a full fledged web series. Things would have gotten explained differently n clearly.Dialogues are below average and we have seen BB with his epic one liners in his YT channel. Al these 8-9 stars are given by BB followers and I am certainly not amazed to see this.\n",
      "Review 4333: The series is good, entertaining & engaging however it is a copy of movie Aa Dekhen Zara starring Neil Nitin Mukesh. The only difference is that the cell phone and news is replaced by Camera which shows the future to main protagonist. The first season ends with gadget showing that Bhuvan Bam's character will die in future is also similar to Aa Dekhen Zara but the character doesnt die. Watch the movie and there will be no surprises left for you. Although a copy but still it is engaging and doesnt let you get bored majorly due to good writing. Apart from Bhuvan Bam all characters have does great job.\n",
      "Review 4334: This was as real as it could get. Few of the news that were happening seemed very less probable to happen together, kind of looked like were present to support the script.I mean this is what would almost happen in real life if such a boon is there. If it wasn't appreciated by someone then they are more into fantasy maybe.Anyway, I kind of find few moments out of play or maybe it's just me.If someone thinks like boon is not possible in real life and all it's not the point. The point is what money does to a person.Some things remain unclear to me still like if Bhuvan was being cheated upon or not. If yes, why?\n",
      "Review 4335: If your looking for something dark and energizing then this show will hit the right spot. This show is one of the best one I've watched in Hindi after a long time basically. It was one of the best thriller and also the dark storyline of how greed can make and destroy humans is shown so well in this show that it's just a blockbuster that's it.GIVE IT A TRY IT'S WORTH YOUR TIME. THE SHOW WON'T DISAPPOINT YOU IN ANY WAY.It would just blow your minds. Bhuvan Bum is the star of the whole show. His skills are so good mahn !! He really did some great job out there.The cast and everything about this show is Amazing.\n",
      "Review 4336: Remarkable amazing performance by everyone and bhuvan's character was unexpectedly dark for the first time. The cinematography, bgm, script writing everything was nice. Even the theme song was nice and interesting and suspenseful. Bhuvan bam has made a nice debut with taaza khabar. All the camera angles were nicely taken. And bhuvan's character transformation and story was like rocky bhai in kgf but unexpectedly dark in the last moments. Just waiting for the next season of taaza khabar and dhindhora. May bhuvan's all dreams come true. He is a true actor. Hats off to all the actors and the production team.\n",
      "Review 4337: The story line was below average and very predictable. It seemed that I watching a kids movie. Shriya pilgaonkar should have chosen a good script, her acting however was good as usual. After watching guilty minds of shriya pilgaonkar, i was expecting another good series but this disappointed me a lot. As soon as the magic part came , it spoiled the excitement. Bhuvan also acted good but the storyline was too weak to support his acting. I wish that in future they should invest their time into a a strong script rather than these kinds of scripts. 8.5 IMDb stars astonish me. In coming days it would settle down to which it deserves.\n",
      "Review 4338: The standard Bhuvan set through his YouTube video and by his very own webseries DHINDHORA that standard has somewhat declined which can be seen in his new YT videos and his new hotstar web series TAAZA KHABAR . The first two episodes excites the viewer at some point but as the episode 3 starts the excitement and standard goes down and down till the end of the series. As a viewer I have seen BB and his YT videos for a very long time and have followed him very closely but this webseries has just weakened my faith and excitement to his new works .At ny personal experience it is not worth it to watch and waste your time.\n",
      "Review 4339: Just bing watch Taaza Khabar and I must say it was amazing, a new concept and realistic acting, and I'm in love with the theme! I started watching him 7-8 years ago, It always feels like I was there with him in his all ups and downs and achievements.He improved a-lot and always try to come with a new concept into BB Ki Vines videos to Titu Talks and Titu Talks to Dhindora, and Dhindora to Taaza Khabar but he never forgot about his passion which was music, He always give his best and make hits.Always appreciate your efforts and hardwork.I am really waiting for the next season.Always a fan of your work.\n",
      "Review 4340: I have been a great fan of 'BB ki Vines' for his Youtube videos, so I watched his Tazza Khabar web series. Launching episode was good, but from 2nd episode it became disgusting, predictable and worse. There is no climax in the story, they plot may be good, but the screenplay, direction, music none of them were good. Bhubhan Bam must focus in his youtube career, instead of doing these. I personally feel his videos far better than this. Most of the youtubers think they are good by changing there field, but they should remember that they are Youtubers and must not forget the support audiences shown for his videos. So insted of becoming popular, by making series or movie, he should focus on his youtube videos. Overall, I will say the series was an average one-time watchable series.\n",
      "Review 4341: This is a knock out of the park from BB and the crew. The story is somewhat predictable but the character development; the direction; and the presentation are all top-notch and keep the viewer engaged throughout. Everyone in the cast has delivered an exceptional performance but credits to BB. His performance is transcendental and his character connects very well with audience. A solid cliffhanger has me waiting curiously and patiently for the next installment in the series (which I hope is on the cards). I am especially looking forward to Madhu's and Shetty's story going forward.Give this show a try. I guarantee you won't regret it.\n",
      "Review 4342: Too much filmy.... Not realistic like nowadays web series. Feels like a communist directed this series. The villain falls in love with a prostitute. The villain is a billianaire & the hero is also the lover of heroin who is a prostitute. So both of them fight just to be with the heroin. Taaza khabar ka concept bhi ek hollywood series ka copy hain. Could have been way better. The heroin after buying a own boutique in Mumbai in a mall couldn't buy a flat for herself and had to go to stay in her earlier stay at the brothel from where she started her journey. The father of hero drinks alcohol all day but refuses to take money from son from front but uses his sons money.\n",
      "Review 4343: Realism at its peak , bhuvan bam is just perfect , simple plot showed in a excellent way , music is very good , i loved bhuvam bam , bhuvam is just flawless in this.And the best part about this show is dialogues üî•Dialogues are so well written like \" naseeb k baarish h ya kismat mere p moot rhi h \" . This show is a good show , u should watch it and its not too long also only 30 mins episodes ! I will say U should surely give it a try u will like it.There are moments in which u will love vasya ( bhuvan bam's character) and there are moments in which u will literally hate him , this is acted in a excellent way by bhuvan bam ! This role was written for him only !\n",
      "Review 4344: Bhuvan Bam is not just an actor but an emotion. Bhai aapka ek interview tha in which you said that you have not reached the hearts of Mature audience just like Sharukh but I just want to say that the way of work you are doing, the selection of your script is just mind blowing. That day was not so far when everbody says Bhuvan is the next superstar.And Baat rahi series ki, isme Bhuvan hai, toh entertainment ki kami ho hi nahi sakti.All I have to say, Bhai milenge apan kabhi, party bhi karenge, aur season 2 bhi le aao Taza Khabar ka, abhi se wait hi nahi ho raha.Your big fan, Love you Brother.\n",

      "Review 4346: Story has some loose ends. But buildup is very good. Bhuvan and Shirya's acting is very excellent, although shriya has already proved her in other series Broken news to be precise but BB has shown his worth in a short series . I watched it for BB and totally worth it for that. I think chije aur better ho sakti thi , 6 episode ki jagah 8 kar skte the. It feels like they ended it in a hurry ( may be due to budget) . But for a start for BB productions or bhuvan as a whole it is satisfactory and respectable. Way to go for capabilities he has. We have watched him enough in BB ki vines we want to watch him on OTT now.\n",
      "Review 4347: The way this story is delivered and the innocence of cast took me from the first episode.....small things which trouble us throughout the day and life have been pictured so important and negligible in the same paradigm as if I wish someone to pinch me wake from this dream...love and best of luck everyone.The way this story is delivered and the innocence of cast took me from the first episode.....small things which trouble us throughout the day and life have been pictured so important and negligible in the same paradigm as if I wish someone to pinch me wake from this dream...love and best of luck everyone.\n",

Kudos team.Also, not so Taaza khabar- Bhuvan is set to be a rockstar! The way every little detail was shown, it just blew our minds away. Something different was witnessed. Definitely a different Bhuvan.The next season will be awaited, and I just hope it comes out soon. Perfect binge watch for this weekend. To be honest I was not expecting it to be this good by the trailer. But when you actually see it, you'll see the nitty gritties which were taken care of.Lovely. Just lovely.\n",
      "Review 4349: Very overrated webseries with missing direction..Ending climax is impt part of story while it was easy to judge since 1st episode.Bhuvan Bam need to focus on real hard work to shine the career. BB shouting was insane, not suiting to character.Villain Character is really missing .. A story is really incomplete in absence of pure villain.. it was looking one sided story only, where hero is everything like south onelove story was dying in story, running at unknown platform, baseless , emotionless..idea was new but quoting of presentation is missing...Very bad Very Bad Vey bad from learning perspective, Promoting to cricket betting and gambling...\n",
      "Review 4350: This kind concept is refreshing in Indian web show space where every show feels like same mirzapur aur sacred games copy. I want more such unique themes to be executed.The tragedy of life was same old formula based. But after that it gets interesting as we get to know the character more.I have one advise for creators that being miserable does not mean you are poor. These characters can be more relatable, if you change the setting environment. Like in kdrama show \"Itaewom\". These things make the character popular and inspiring rather than just using it as a vessel for getting entertainment.\n",
      "Review 4351: This is by far the best series I've watched. If you don't know bhuvan bam (the main character) then i can say you'll find this series 7 on the scale of 10. I'm giving it 10 because of being a big fan of bb and because i liked the performance he showed in the series. If you're looking for suspense fun struggle and action then this is one packed series for you. The character development in only 6 episodes made me feel like i watched more then 20 episodes. Great job bb! Just need to work on some acting skills like : you screaming \"whoooooo\" felt little odd. Just be the same bb you are! Amazing work!\n",
      "Review 4352: What a performance. BB has outperformed all the expectations. Action sequences were lit. What a emotionally charged direction. Watching Bhuwan in this new Avatar was a delight for us. Storyline is superb, concept might be old but execution is fresh. Every character justified the script and performed with full potential. Second season awaited...BB has tremendous potential for a long journey. We have seen BB's progress since first vine with a phone camera. He made us laugh with every sketch. Then Performance like \"Plus Minus\" made us cry. We loved him in tremendous Dhindhora.. and now.. Vasya bhai... Love for every performance of BB.\n",
      "Review 4353: This was unexpected. The concept, the plot, actors, especially Bhuvan Bam (he's been a complete and fine actor). What I like the most about this series is it's filled with multiple twists. I can call this series a masterpiece because the kind of work they have done is very detailed.Whether it's an innocent guy look or a bad one - Bhuvan Bam did it quite well. Apart from this, I love the cinematography of this series a lot. Once you see it, you will know why. All the angles they have shot from and the way everything transitioned is outstanding. Now if we talk about music, I loved all of the songs. The lyrics sync well with the storyline.\n",

I am definately say that after SRK there is only 1 name Bhuvan Bam.He will be ruling on all industry in future because he is not only creator and director he makes people very relatable the way he acted in Taaza khabar.. Amazing series i gonna say being youtuber its very excited to watch him on OTT now.ActingFightStoryComedyOverall good.\n",
      "Review 4355: The series was not quite catchy at first but it turns out to be more interesting and entertaining than expected. Also the experience of Dolby Atmos and High quality Audio Video will blow your mind. The production quality is awesome. The storyline evolves smoothly and also the actors have done great work. I found it to be a bit boring but never expected it to be so good afterwards. Bhuvan Bhai has done a phenomenal work. Absolutely worth watching. The actors have acted naturally and there are no overacting and exaggerated scenes. I was impressed with the direction as well. The story is perfect.\n",

Just loved it. Hope he makes more of these web series along with Mr. Rohit and kudos also to everyone else for their Awesome performance.Mehboob Bhai, Shriya, his friend everyone did a fabulous job.Buy this was made to be a One man show and it stands true on its words and potrays Buvan Bam as an absolute superstar and it belongs to him showcasing him at its best and hopefully more to come.\n",
      "Review 4357: You not only meet our expectations but always go beyond that. I loved this series of his new role of acting. You always deliver high-quality work. It'd be great to see you maintain this standard. I think everyone saw BB as a comedian and we also know he is more than that. Here, we can see his all deeds and expression of emotion, daring, passionate. It will go into the blockbuster series. Your dedication to achieving positive outcomes has been astonishing. You'll go far.Your work is a joy to watch. No wonder I can't wait to see anything new you work on...Lots of love BB.#disneyhotstar #Tazakhabar #streaming #BBkivines #BB.\n",
      "Review 4358: This series is something unique , credit to Husain and Abbas Dalal and their Late Father for this really good concept. The series is not too long and not too short. It's like watching a 3 hour movie. Credit to all the actors in the series. From Small to lead everyone we're commendable. The story is predictable once things go the right track for Vasya. Would like to see some more twists in the coming season.Love you Bhuvan , your acting was fantastic. A fan of your work since 2016. So happy for the musicians too. Fantastic job.

Must watch..This is a story of Vasya, a boy with a humble background in Mumbai. It showcases how the life of the boy changes when he gets a boon through which he starts getting news well before time. Further the story continues and showcases how vasya uses this boon to help his friends and himself. The story also give some insight into how many and power changes people. The story ends on an interesting note and everyone one must watch the series to know how it ends.\n",

      "Review 4362: The series had an overall ok plot , but Bhuvan's acting made it so much better . They could however remove some toilet and poop scenes or add a notice that it includes such scenes , because while wasting I started watching the show and I almost puked. The story is just like another Bollywood story where a poor fellow becomes rich and then ignores everyone and then at the end regrets leaving his loved ones behind . I feel that the show just got carried by BB story was rather bad than what I was expecting. Dhindora was a better story than this one . Hopefully season 2 is different than season one.\n",
      "Review 4363: This is bhuvan bam debut outside youtube and this is the real beauty because his acting is too good and script selection of bb is also awesome because he is also producer of the series I know the concept of the series is not too complex or unique but the execution of this concept is too awesome and the length of every and each episode is just perfect it's like there is no air remain in the packet of the series totally opposite to lays üòÇüòÇ the over all screen time of the series is approximately 3¬Ω over so you can watch easily and in acting segment they did excellent work and also background music and songs too soothing and they fitted well in every situation so you can feel the impact of every bgm and songs so my final verdict is this series is too good you should watch this series but not with family and also do not watch 1 and 2 episode during eating something ü§£üòÇ\n",
      "Review 4364: The acting and the Cast was really awesome. But the story was quite simple and easily predictable. The concept was different and unique in my point of view however there should have been some twists and adventures etc.About the cast... Well Bhuvan Bam's acting was superb and all the casts specially his mother and his side kick was superb too. In future, Bhuvan should do some more good series toom it was really great of him in all manner. He has proven that he is a pro in the field of acting. I wish he would get more offers and will succeed in the future. My best wishes for him.Over all experience was superb by the way.\n",
      "Review 4365: Delight to watch BB in a Grey Avataar, he has some amazing acting skills one literally forgets he is BB, the fact is he is not from theatre such finesse in his acting skills. The plot could have been boring but the team has presented in very fresh way. The other cast also did a good job.If it has been a Bollywood movie it will have worked well. He is the next Aamir Khan in choosing subjects has a great eye on scripts and projects he is associated with.All the best BB .. Give some more content.. your base is YouTube please keep uploading content on a regularly basis.Surprise us with a Twist with a part 2.\n",
      "Review 4366: The webseries was amazing and as it had less episodes it feels good . The main highlight of the show was its main leading actor Mr Bhuvan Bam . But the plot of the story was felt half baked because a story contains a start , it's middle and a end but Taza Khabar had its start and a long middle and there was no end . The first half was good but second half it felt like the story was running . The show could had about 8 to 10 episodes of about 30 min . The main lead actor of Taza Khabar Mr . Bhuvan Bam acting was fabulous and writing of the characters of the show was fabulous. Overall the show was amazing and Fabulous üòç\n",
      "Review 4367: A great and a strong message of the thought\" Money can't buy you happiness \" and always be humble no matter how much you earn success in your life. Brilliant acting and delivery by Bhuvan Bam! A perfect length of the web series. Not too long or too short. It's purely a masterpiece. Such a brilliant acting done by a YouTuber who was the first to reach 10 Million Subscribers on YouTube from India. Truly a work of art. It's very engaging and something fresh after a long time happened in India and Bollywood and overall acting industries. All characters had proper acting and all performed very well. Truly a wonderful series! Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Review 4368: It is a very good web series which everyone should watch. The performance of BB and other actors was also wonderful. It's storyline is also unique. It is so enjoyable that u won't get bored except the starting. The entry of Vasant Gawde is also over the top. It has everything that we want to see nowadays. It also goes with a dark humor and it's comedy is also good. Their emotional angle is not that relatable to everyone. I loved it's love angle and the cinematography. The villain in the series is not that good. It had few illogical scenes. But that can be ignored easily. Which is not that big con.\n",
      "Review 4369: The story is quit connect to the last YouTube TV series ( Dhindora ). I feel like there are minor different between these TV series. Overall, the TV series was enjoyable and any age people can watch and enjoy the story. I give this TV series solid 7 out of 10. All cost doing there job very brilliantly. The story plot was good, and content with various twists, which was much enjoyable. The story line is so interesting that you won't even feel the length of the series. There's not a minute in any episode where you get bored, it completely make you feel like you are in there. It is so much better than most Bollywood movies. I mean it.\n",
      "Review 4370: Absolutely amazing. Dhindora was good but this honestly something else. The gradual transition of bhuvan bam's character felt so organic and natural. The screenplay, writing, setting, direction, costumes, characters all felt so real and relatable. BBKV did an immaculate job in creating a show that appeals to virtually every indian and proved their true skill. Most 'critics' on the internet are criticising taaza khabar for being too 'predictable', but i see this as a futile and lame excuse to downgrade this show. The fact of the matter is that taaza khabar might be predictable but while u are watching it, it keeps u gripped and hooked for every second, giving you no time to think about what would happen next. It makes u admire each second of the show. Whether its predictable or not, it feels truly real and relatable.\n",
      "Review 4371: As soon as the web series was over, I felt this enormous weight fall over me. It experiences a great deal of suffering, and the path to happiness is difficult. The entire cast and crew of this web series deserves praise for creating such a masterpiece. You all should watch this lovely presentation, is the only thing I want to say. Exceptionally well done! Everything: the script, the audio, the acting, the camera work, etc. Awesome! I agree that there were a few errors here and there, but I am writing this favorable evaluation because I saw believability features in this web series rather than flaws.Love You Bhuvan Bhai.\n",
      "Review 4372: Wow, I just had an amazing time binge-watching the series and I can confidently say that BB is truly a talented and versatile actor who will undoubtedly do wonders in the future. He has so much more to offer than just comedy and I can't wait to see all the amazing things he will accomplish. I believe he will be recognized as the true talent he is in just a matter of time.The series itself was fantastic, it starts off strong and takes its time introducing all the characters in a way that keeps us engaged. The pacing is just perfect, it doesn't rush towards the conclusion, but also doesn't drag on. Each episode is around 40 minutes which is the perfect length to keep us captivated till the end. The storyline is well-written and executed, I especially loved how everything comes together in the end. I highly recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a great watch.\n",
      "Review 4373: I have been waiting for a show or series like this , a little fiction mixed with day to day difficulties of a common man. Literally finished all the episodes of the first season the moment it was live, it was that good. And obviously it's Bhuvan Bam and clearly he doesn't disappoints . Coming after his YouTube show dhindhora this one took his acting skills up a notch and let me tell you the whole cast is amazing. It's not a family show but you will definitely love it. The way they depict the daily life of a toilet watchmen i guess is also very good, one thing that could have been better would be the buildup of him getting rich, it felt like he became rich to quickly imo. Overall great show.\n",
      "Review 4374: I was waiting for it for a long time and it really didn't disappoint me with the story and acting.But between the episodes I was hoping to see other BB ki vines characters like banchordas and Sameer. But they didn't show upOther than that I really enjoyed it.U can say that it is a family. Only some scenes contain gali but it is not much to be bothered.You can watch it with your family and girlfriend and ofcourse boyfriendI was following BB ki vines for more than 4 or 5 yearsHis YouTube videos were cool and also make my days happyI know that BB is trying to bigger things and achieve big but I will always wait for his YouTube videos.\n",
      "Review 4375: Just next level web series by bhuvan bam.and bb ki vines production.they really make a entertaining show as well as they give social message in a very humours way.this series includes every single type of gener.There are total six episodes but while you watching them you can't feel that you are boring are you are watching something lengthi thing which is six episodes long.Not a single episode disappointes you in aspect of entertainment and drama.The cast, story in the series is also next level.actors like Prathamesh parab and Shreya literally nailed it. This web tells you a middle class boy whose life is completely changed after a miracle happened with him.\n",
      "Review 4376: The story line was good, althought bit predictable but still good, like after watching the trailer I was not expecting this, but by the start of the last episode I knew something like this was coming. By the trailer I was expecting it to be more on comedy side. But feels so good to see bhuvan in a completely new character. Every other actor also good, whether it was Peter, shazia or madhu. Everybody did a fantastic job and did justice to there roles. They kept the series short with only 6 episodes, that was good, but If there was a song also sang by bhuvan than it would have been an icing on the cake. Expecting it in the second season. Already excited for it.\n",
      "Review 4377: I feel happy and sad for this amazing actorHappy knowing and seeing that he is going to make it BIG and sad because his life's most important people couldnt see him getting THEREBut I consider him as my family and will watch every single work of his till I am there and cheer for himI could see the amount of efforts that have gone in making thisGood fictional story with amazing actors and their actingUnfortunately I watched it on the very first day and now I feel bad that i will have to wait for the next season! Hope it comes soonTill then hoping that Dhindora season 2 releases ASAPAll the very best friend.\n",
      "Review 4378: I am really telling all of you that it is one of the favourite webseries according to me. Because its action, comedy and story is amazing.I love the scene which comes at first and i can't believe that the story is finish with the first scene. That scene combination is so amazing that snatches my heart.I don't tell about the characters because all the characters are legends and they plays a vast role to make it this. Many many hats off to all characters to perform this type of legendary web series. The production and direction is so amazing.Over all i really love this. And this webseries how many times you see i tell you that it always gives you a legendary vibes.\n",

Bhuvan amazing job love you bro.#taaza khabar best series ever.\n",
      "Review 4381: Straight 5 stars to BB 's acting, but not surprised either by your acting or the plot line. You have set benchmark in Dhindhora hence, knew that you will smack the role in Taaza Khabar too.Rest 3 stars are just for your team-mates' efforts. Also, story arch is left incomplete and expect lots of twist in the upcoming season.Your audience is just comparing you to you. You have given such wonderful experience in Dhindhora that we guys want more like that and not less.Best wishes to bang on in the next season of Taaza Khabar. Like you surprised us this time by streaming a day before, just like Taaza Khabar. So, we want shock for the next time by extraordinary story line.\n",
      "Review 4382: Amazing acting, wonderful direction and really good music makes this show worth watching or at least giving a try. The plot is a bit predictable but still enjoyable.Seeing Bhuvan Bam's performance was heartwarming for me as someone who has been following him for quite a while now.I especially loved the use of color in the series. From the smallest of shots to the biggest of events had a beautiful aura around it which was complimented by the colors.The music in this series is also really good to the ears + the surprise nod to Phir Hera Pheri was really nice to see.Excited to watch season 2.\n",
      "Review 4383: Amazing. There are remarkably multiple amazing movies to choose from. If I had to pick 10 of the greatest films of all time they would include suspense and action. The list of movies that I have picked out are in my opinion the greatest films of all time. In the cinema, there are hundreds and hundreds of memorable moments and scenes from many films. The reason behind this is because the ten movies that I have picked out have compelled me to ''relive'' the moment. Therefore they give me a memory that I will hold on to.If a movie changes you mine it's not because of your reasoning it's because of your emotions that you feel towards the movie. My 10 greatest films must be films that fascinate me and pull me in quickly. They need to embezzle my attention and keep me entertained at all times.\n",
      "Review 4384: I can surely say bb is the new start who is going to rule the bollywood. I binge watched it the day it came and i can say it was worth watching and it just show he can do so much more than just comedy. There was was alot of detailing in the series. The story telling was one of the best aspects. The things i liked first wonderful characters second beats the expected bollywood movie/web series Third excellent acting but there is one thing I don't like it is the predictable plot this is the reason i gave it 9 stars. The major credit goes to the writers. Overall the series is excellent and a must watch. BB i am just waiting for a new movie or web series.\n",
      "Review 4385: After seen the series.. I just felt bbk just created a dream come true of a lower middle class young lad. Yes I think he did a marvelous job and ispired so many youth who want to be vasant gowde.. who work hard every day and dream every ni8 to live like king.As a 90's kid from lower middle class background i am very much inspired by SRK.. and in this digital era, after seen Taza khabar bbk give me same type of goosebumps same type of feeling..Eagerly waiting for the next season. But I think we all was expecting the last episode may be end like this.Last but not the least, VASYU is not a hero neither a negative character, you cannt hate him neither you love, still you will become a fan.BBK and every other actors did very well. Be d revolution BBK. Best wishes üëç\n",
      "Review 4386: This guy can literally play any character specially a deranged one. He plays the role of vatsya like he is a professional actor but he is fairly new in the field and he certainly deserves to be in theatres. Regarding the show that i binged in less than 24 hours, it surprised me how mediocre the plot is but still manage to keep me hooked. Nothing really surprising here in the show, the only other extraordinary thing was how humble the character was in the initial episodes, that didn't last long. Regarding i feel the show is slightly overrated but has a great cast and nice dialogue delivery. Great production as a commercial show.\n",
      "Review 4387: OMG ! Just Saw The Taaza Khabar & So Shocked How Bhuvan & All Characters Worked Well in it .. Hats Off To Bhuvan ! How Story Goes & Staying Connected With Us .. From First To Last Episode ..... Unbelievable ! Bhuvan Bro You Got Your Pace .. Never Stop .. Keep Working.. We Are Here To Support You .. One Of The Best & Realestic Story i Had Ever Seen .. That Visuals .... That Background Score.. All Were So Well !! Bhuvan Performance Was Stunning & Outstanding .. it's Just One Of The Best Ever Indian Web Series.. i Love Bhuvan Bam From A Very While .. He is Just . . . . . . Here's My Review Over My Favourite YouTuber's First Web Series.\n",
      "Review 4388: Bhuvan has proved that he is more than a comedic youtube influencer. The series has a very intriguing story from end to end. It might not be complicated like sherlock holmes but not every series has to be a thriller. Simple story, simple execution. We can see the change in the characters and how they interact with others. Ends it with a nice cliff hanger. Waiting for season 2. All the other actors have also played a very important part in the story. They have thrown themselves into the characters life and you do not feel a disconnect between the person on the screen and the actor who is playing it.\n",
      "Review 4389: Best part:- was Music drop, the lighting - which takes you to MUMBAI CHAWL, STREETS, the Toilet scene was actually disturbing, but actors played the part really well.Bad Part:- Story has only the success part, it was not giving any roller coaster ride, it was going predictable and I watched 1.5x and skipped story sometimes. I was expecting that what If POLICE/CBI caught him, that part could bring more adventures.Overall- Bhuvan Bam was the center of excellence in this series. Other Actors Madhu, And Bakery Man etc were experienced actors too. They all did their part with 100% efforts.It's a worth watching OTT experience.\n",
      "Review 4390: Just finished watching this webseries, I love & serformance gajab can't explain this series in words...just love it. BB is amazing. He is the best comedian. And how efficiently he does all the roles himself.A good-for-nothing boy from the lower middle-class strata of Mumbai gets a boon just around his 25th birthday. He can see the future and he decides to use it to earn big. But with time the power turns into a curse as it starts playing with his head and turns him into a demon he always feared. The first episode introduces us to the helplessness of everyone on the main team. There is an ambition to rise above but no means.\n",
      "Review 4391: Bhuvan Bam Sir, A big applause for your hardwork and dedication through your entire life and we are really happy to see you at this stage and your talent has made everyone to love you so much..A Series with proper screenplay,bgm and story..The BEST!Taaza khabar has made a very big impact on everyone and people have been waiting for this series for a long time now and it was totally worth every second of the wait..Nice work taaza khabar team..even the side characters have been performed to an excellent job and each and every scene is so interesting to watch..kudos to the team and really waiting for a season 2 if there is one!!\n",
      "Review 4392: Taaza khabar his first ott master piece and he killed in this series. As we were expecting from bhuvan he gave us like that.story is wowww and talk to with bhuvam performance was awesome. His character generating a impact like now don't loose hope and won't to be hopeless and the bhuvan character have so energetic. The title of the series taaza khabar was totally fits his full showdown and the runtime of the episodes quite good, songs also, background score were awesome.other actors and character are also have awesome performance. But sometimes i missed somewhere bhenchordass,titu mama ,sameer cuz they have big plot in our mind and heart. So thnxx for bhuvan.\n",
      "Review 4393: Ok I don't really like the web series made by youtubers but this one hits different. From the day teaser launched I was so hyped for this series and the good part is they launched all 6 episode in one day and I finished it today. Taza khabar taza concept . Hundred times better then dhindora can't wait for the season two of taza khabar the dress, cinematography, story everything is good and better than some Bollywood movies. Overall best of best and you should watch it instead of movie circus that movie is just waste of money and thank to BB ki vines to create such a masterpiece for us. Go and watch.\n",

Bhuvan is fabulous with fabulous talant ..more series should come and this should achieve a remarkable fame ...go ahead with all your future plans and taaza khabar will definitely will be always taaza for audience because i think everyone will see it again and again it is not going to be boring for audience ..keep growing and bring more series üòç\n",

Another blockbuster after dhindhora. Love the way he's growing. Hat's off to the acting, story and direction. Waiting for more! This one should get hit so that we can boost up his confidence. Bhuvan was really worried about this project, whether it might get sucess or not. But after watching it i feel it is going to be a massive success and it's worth watching it. I'm totally in love with all his works and always wating for more. üñ§\n",

He is showing his skills how capable he is. He has potential to seek attention of every viewer and convence every one towards his loyalty of his work.His new series taaza khabar is also amazing he surprised me again with his acting and really loved a lot this series.

Story is too simple but his acting make it extraordinary after all i would say Bhuvam Bro Killed it. Every Web show lover must watch this.The Casting of this show is full of talent and I am a big fan of Shriya Pilgaonkar her acting is totally natural it feels like real and it makes this series extraordinary and blockbuster.About other actors and actresses they are too much experienced. I loved this Show. Enjoy it and go fast And finish it now.\n",

Don't want to say BB is underrated after 5-10 years from now.Now let's talk about series, It started all good and takes it times to introduce all the characters however it feels like rushing towards the conclusion in mid episodes. Surely wanted each episode to be around 40mins at least, that would help to keep us engaging till end. After episode 3 everything seems to be going it boom... this.... and than....

      "Review 4407: This show had everything. It was thrilling. A good storyline. Rags to riches story. This show is the perfect debut for bhuvan outside his own universe. His acting was incredible. At the start you would think of him as bhuvan but as the story goes on you get so indulged in the story that you see him as his character Vasant Gawde. All the sidecast did a great job portraying their characters. But bhuvan did something that we haven't seen him do before and he fits his character perfectly. It's a great show with good comic timing, well written screenplay and dialogues and some moments which will keep you on the edge of your seat. I know that if someone decides to criticize the show they can go as low as they want. But for BB doing something beyond expectations and deliver such an amazing product in the time where almost everything is getting worse in terms of entertainment, I'd have to give it a 10/10. It was a refreshing ride and I would highly recommend watching it. Show is completely binge-watchable. Please do watch it.\n",

It was inspiring at the same time there was so much to learn from this webseries and Dialogues were just Perfect. Very Happy for BB Sir. Ye to BB sir ki Shuruwat hai ab aage aage Deko hota hai kya.

Other actors & actresses executed their part really well. I'm strongly recommending this to everyone. Just wow!!The plot seems so real & authentic. It feels like I'm watching myself on the screen. I would suggest everyone to binge watch this series because the whole series is of 3 hours only. The technical aspect was also on point. The lighting, script, everything was so perfect. It is so much better than most bollywood movies. I mean it.\n",
      "Review 4411: In this, Naseer ji shines brightest among all his other accomplishments. Amazing work. I eagerly await each new installment of these series. First, I mistook the actor playing Saleem for Aditya Roy Kapoor because of how well he played the role. The film appears to be of high quality, therefore I will definitely watch it. Job well done All of the actors are top-notch, and the script is superb. All of the acts completely floored me. Includes a cameo appearance by Dharmendra. I've seen Dharam Paji twice before, and I can recognize him by his aura and what he said. If a TV series is truly magnificent, viewers will likely binge-watch the entire thing in one sitting.\n",

Acting wise only Nasir Sir is good but rest are okay okay to below average. VFX is very na√Øve and even a school student can figure out that this particular scene is fake. I don't understand and don't know when Hindi movie director would start taking audience seriously. If there would have option for zero rating, I would have given it, but I don't have option so giving only one star.\n",

      "Review 4414: Dharmendra Ji, a legendary figure in Bollywood, makes his debut in this movie. Seeing him perform is well worth your time, even if nothing else. Naseeruddin Shah is notable for his easy charm and sense of style in addition to Dharmendra. Now, this series is receiving nothing but positive reviews on the internet. Although storytelling isn't bad, it might be. A must-see, but not for everyone, for lovers of Naseeruddin Shah and Dharmendra. Although it is true that Bollywood films based on the Mughal Empire are more concerned with show than with accuracy, you may still have fun while watching them.\n",
      "Review 4415: The show supposed to be promising and portraying the life of the Mughals, specially their tricks, politics and stories. But this show is full of historical errors and some of the events are completely opposite than the reality. Why is this show distorting historical events, or characters? These minor changes are not helping the show either. Not sure if it's against the law to falsify historical information, unless this show is a fiction.Actors selected are not well fit to the historical persons in this show, specially Jahangir. VFX in this show is awful and some of the graphics are just laughable.Some of the dialogues are so cringeworthy and horrendous. Mughals did not speak or act in certain ways that this show tried to portray. I guess the show creators made the Mughals look like Indian serial dialogues and acting, similar to Ekta Kapoor serials.\n",
      "Review 4416: This series provides an outstanding introduction to the Mughal Empire. I anticipate seeing something authentic on television. Everyone in front of and behind the camera has labored very diligently!!! Sir Dharam's ascent to the throne. This is a program that I will definitely watch. Dharam paaji, Naseer sir, and Aditi Rao hydari deserve all the credit. A novel interpretation of the Salim Anarkali legend. This is the first time I have encountered something like. That is a sharp contrast to typical Bollywood entertainment and extremely gloomy. Determine which organization will organize the next demonstration.\n",
      "Review 4417: I always prefer history, just visited Agra and Delhi...Akbar is my favourite for his respect and view on our religion.Watch it u will enjoy but one thing needs to be changed that Salim was not \"Takht e taj\" ka bhukha ; as per real history he was hungry for power. Akbar loved his grandsons more than his sons, and he was all time best the similarity b/w both Akbar and Salim was - they both stopped slaughtering of Cows.They both loved Hindus unlike Aurangzeb.Watch without thinking twice, Nd Akbar thoda young hota to aur zyada acha lagta but acting of everyone was superb üëçüèª. A Must watch WS...\n",
      "Review 4418: Naseer ji at his absolute best! Great performance. I eagerly anticipate each installment of these series. Because of his outstanding performance, I mistook the actor portraying Saleem for Aditya Roy Kapoor. The film appears to be of high quality, and I want to watch it. Fantastic work The writing is outstanding, as are all of the performances. Each and every one of them really blew me away with their performances. Dharmendra briefly appears in the film. I've seen Dharam Paji twice and know him based on his aura and the words he's spoken. Very sure, the entire series will be seen in one sitting.\n",
      "Review 4419: To be honest, I had no idea that this movie about the Taj Mahal would end up being one of the most impressive historical dramas ever filmed about India. I like how the information centered upon cultural diversity and served as a great primer for learning more about the nuances of this important topic. The film's stunning and fascinating qualities make it a must-watch. The video continues to astound me, therefore I find myself watching it again. Everyone gave an outstanding performance. Bollywood productions based on the Mughal Empire tend to prioritize flash over realism, but that doesn't mean they can't be enjoyable.\n",
      "Review 4420: Anyone can debate history and dig it but as a film this whole series is just amazing.The story the pace , direction and potryal of historic characters that we have read about in our history books is just astounding.I will not get into details of the story but there is absolutely no other story or film that is a good as this of course minus the classic deleep Kumar film that still stands out . But this one is not as subtle and brings all characters to life as never seen or read before.As a film It stands out who ever played saleem is good only one guy known is nassiruddin shah . Loved it absolutely must watch.\n",
      "Review 4421: This could have been an epic if directed well and actors did their job. But it seems like watching a Skit of children at school function. No good acting,no good direction,no good VFX , it's all just waste of an great idea . The epics should be authentic to watch like game of thrones,house of the dragons . These are some direction cult series which are created like an actual places and locations . That level of VFX and dramatic representation is absent here. They did poor job very poor. Dialogue delivery of actors are just pathetic and no good bgm , overall it's an low very low level cinematography.\n",
      "Review 4422: One episode into the series, I was hooked on to the magnitude and the detailing of this legendary chapter from our history books.Watching Nasseruddin Shah as Akbar is a treat in itself. The poise he brings to the character is one for the ages. The music, the set design, the cinematography, the lighting, the writing, the dialogues, everything seems to be coming together really well. I hate to use this clich√© but it does have a very international \"Game Of Thrones\" feel to it's treatment which is refreshing to see for the Indian audience. A brilliant attempt by the film maker. Waiting for season 2!\n",
      "Review 4423: The series demonstrates the Indian film industry's high degree of talent and inventiveness. It also exhibits India's rich and distinguished cultural heritage. It is a work of art that merits all of the praise it has earned and more. The historical drama \"Taj\" is aesthetically gorgeous and vast. The film, which is directed by Ron Scalpello and depicts an epic tale, is in cinematic form. The film offers several breathtakingly beautiful sequences. The elaborate clothes and extravagant staging transfer the audience to another time period. Naseeruddin Shah provides an outstanding performance as Akbar.\n",
      "Review 4424: Amazing cinematography by Taj helps to the overall tone of the film. That is excellent and blends in well with the rest of the activity. I will continue to ponder about Divided By Blood after the conclusion of the series. At least one episode of the television show Divided By Blood should be viewed by everyone. The relatively high quality of Taj: Divided by Blood's production design contributes to the overall sense that the game is more realistic. The pace of the narrative is optimal, never moving too slowly or too quickly. The skilled handling of character development generates a sense of fulfillment.\n",
      "Review 4425: The trailer indicates that the film will be excellent. I cannot wait to watch the film! Famous actors all feature in the same film. Aditi Rao Hydari is a Gem! After watching Padmavat, I wished to see her again! Legendary performers Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah deliver outstanding performances among a stellar group. This is the type of true Mughal historical content we're searching for: captivating, featuring both seasoned and up-and-coming actors, and with a fantastic script. I'm relieved to discover that this show appears to meet or exceed my expectations. I hope they create a story that is both captivating and rich in detail.\n",
      "Review 4426: Taj's cinematography is breathtaking, and it helps to establish the film's tone. It blends flawlessly with the rest of the action and is of the highest quality. Once the series concludes, I will continue to consider Divided By Blood. Each individual should watch at least one portion of the television program Divided By Blood. The great quality of the production design in Taj: Divided by Blood helps to the overall impression that the game is more realistic. The pacing of the narrative is ideal, neither moving too slowly or too rapidly. Character growth is handled skillfully and delivers a sense of satisfaction.\n",
      "Review 4427: Realistic, original and wonderful to watch . It is a nice binge watch for the weekend. Nice sets, acting and good cinematography.Not sure why there is a bad review for this show. Also, please don't go by history as this is an enjoyable story to watch but many facts are historically distorted . Aashim Gulati is a treat to watch and will wait for season 2. Aditi Rao Hydari looks beautiful and pretty as Anarkali.Please watch this show and don't fall for the negative reviews.Naseeruddin Shah has done a brilliant job as Akbar and everything looks perfectly nice in this brilliant attempt of period drama.\n",
      "Review 4428: If anyone wants to see a historical comedy series then Taj is real example. Fort of emperors are like garden - anyone can go in and anyone can go out - no security nothing. Real odd figure is Akbar. Such a short personality which is weakest thing of entire webseries. Nothing to do with reality. I dont know how it got through to OTT. All events shown are way away from reality. Real time waste and such writer ahould be banned who play with facts and real history. All kings and princes are like jokers twisted by their ministers. How come a king has no sense and decision making capabilities. Another useless character is Anarkali.\n",
      "Review 4429: The trailer looks like it's going to be spectacular. I can hardly wait to see the movie! All of the legendary actors in one picture. Aditi rao hydari is a Gem.! Was hoping to get another glimpse of her after seeing her in Padmavat.! Legends Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah deliver a fantastic performance, along with a lovely star cast. Now this is the kind of authentic Mughal history content we are looking for: exciting, starring both seasoned performers and up-and-coming talent, and with an excellent storyline.

      "Review 4430: At this point, Naseer ji is performing at the top of his game. This was a fantastic showing. I look forward to the next episode in these series. At first, I thought the guy playing Saleem was actually Aditya Roy Kapoor because of how well he played the role. The trailer made the film look really good, so I'll probably end up seeing it. Excellent effort The storyline is excellent, and the performances are all top-notch. Each and every one of you gave a performance that just floored me. Dharmendra appears in a brief cameo role. Dharam Paji, whom I have met twice previously and can now identify by his presence and what he says alone. Such a magnificent series will almost certainly be seen in its entirety in a single sitting.\n",
      "Review 4431: At his absolute best, Naseer sir! Excellent performance. I anxiously anticipate each installment of these television programs.

The supporting ensemble also performs well, with each actor giving their parts a tremendous deal of intricacy and depth. The program educates as well as being entertaining to watch.

      "Review 4444: Al the characters have played really well. Location and background is also very good. Twists keep on coming after every episodes. Initially Neseeruddin looks dull in the character of Akbar but as the storyline goes down one would believe that he is the only real Akbar. I think that's why he is still the finest actor in the Bollywood. We can say it's the Indian veraipn of GOT. It's all about the battle for the throne within a family. Saleem, Abarkali, Marad, Daniyal, Abi Fazl etc. Are the characters which are the backbone of this tale. Best part is it never glamourize the false history and always try to be on the fair side.\n",

I've recently discovered that Taj's Split by Blood series is one of my favorites of all time. The environment of Taj: Split by Blood is well developed, adding to the story's realism.\n",
      "Review 4463: Getting to know the Mughal Empire is fun and easy with this series. It looks like I may be able to watch something real for a change. All the people in it, both on and off screen, have worked really hard. Rising of Sir Dharam. Without a doubt, I will tune in to this show. All the credit goes to Dharam paaji, Naseer sir, and Aditi Rao hydari. A fresh take on the Salim Anarkali legend. Something like this has never happened to me before. It's a dark and unusual take on the Bollywood genre. Find out who will be the next to protest. I like it is very nice good best I am good it is very nice best good.\n",
      "Review 4464: I love the series and the direction a lot. All the character are well defined. VFX is at its best i must say, such a good knowledge of history has came out for many of people who are not much aware of this. All the costumes and jewellery is very nice. Best team of actors came out with excellent work.Such great sets have been used, the war in the second episodeIs very well shown.The sets are grand, shot taking is very different. The best part is also the background score for every situation which gives a best feel for overall scenes. Love the story, camera work , music. Master peace it is.\n",
      "Review 4465: What a show. This one looks grand. Saw the first 3 Episodes looking forward for the rest of it. Great way of knowing about the unknown facts of history. The story, the cast, the vfx, the shot taking is so different. I don't think I have seen anything of this level in the ott platform before. I like how every character is standing out and has played their part to the T. The dialogues are very interesting and gripping. Love the entry of Anarkali she has really played it well and couldn't thinknif anyone else for this character. Naseer ji has so much hold in every scene. I am looking forward for the further episodes of the show.\n",
      "Review 4466: The visual style and tone that Taj brings to the camera work is stunning. It's of the greatest quality and fits in perfectly with the rest of the scene. Once the last episode of the season airs, I will still think about Divided By Blood. Everyone should devote at least some of their time to watching the TV show Divided By Blood. Taj: Divided by Blood's high level of production design contributes to the game's realism. The story flows at the perfect pace, never dragging or racing forward. The development of the characters is handled expertly and provides emotional payoff......... I really like this movie.\n",
      "Review 4467: Naseeruddin Shah does an excellent job of portraying the character's ruthlessness and heartlessness. One of the film's finest elements is its soundtrack, which is both scary and wonderfully beautiful. The score, which includes both songs and background music, adds to the emotional qualities of the film and makes it a more fascinating experience altogether. Finally, \"Taj\" is a film that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates grand historical dramas or a lot of action on the big screen. Many people will remember this film for a long time because of how well the performers performed their roles.\n",
      "Review 4468: The trailer promises that the movie will be fantastic. I can't wait to see the movie! All of the famous actors appear in the same film. Aditi Rao Hydari is a Gem! I longed to see her again after seeing her in Padmavat! Among a superb cast, legendary actors Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah provide remarkable performances. This is the sort of authentic Mughal historical material we're looking for: gripping, starring both seasoned and new talents, and with a brilliant script. I'm relieved to find that this show looks to fulfill or surpass my expectations. I hope they tell a tale that is both intriguing and detailed.\n",
      "Review 4469: The series exemplifies the great degree of competence and inventiveness that exists in the Indian film industry. It also highlights India's rich and distinguished cultural past. It is a work of art that is deserving of all the plaudits it has won. The historical drama \"Taj\" is aesthetically magnificent and sprawling. The film, directed by Ron Scalpello and telling an epic narrative, is in cinematic form. The film offers several breathtakingly beautiful sequences. The magnificent clothes and extravagant production take the audience to another age. Naseeruddin Shah provides an outstanding performance as Akbar..\n",
      "Review 4470: After watching this web-series, I regained my hate towards Mughals. What a great work by director and actors. Nasiruddin shah flawless acting, rest other actors were perfect too. Great vfx , great story presentation and overall. The writing, which had kept us engaged till then, starts getting repetitive, which leads to the flaws which we had managed to ignore demanding our attention.Shilajit Mitra for The Hindu wrote \"We get a mammoth battle sequence in Kabul near the start. Though immensely staged, it bored me to bits with its obvious choreography (first the archers come on, then the infantry, then the cannonballs...). Far more memorable, then, is this exchange between Akbar and his ministers, after he announces his plans for 'Din-I-Illahi'. They look crestfallen until one of them calls for a change in conventional thinking.\"\n",
      "Review 4471: There's a sense of awe and anticipation from the teaser. The movie has me so excited! It's a who's who of Hollywood royalty, all in one film. Gem that Aditi rao hydari is. After seeing her in Padmavat, I hoped to catch a glimpse of her again. Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah, two legends in their own right, give outstanding performances, and the rest of the cast is charming as well. This is the kind of interesting, well-acted, and original entertainment set in the time of the Mughals that we would want to see. I'm relieved that the quality of the finished product appears to be up to par with my expectations. To that end, I'm crossing my fingers for an engaging and intricate plot.\n",
      "Review 4472: Taj Divided By Blood & Others, an expansive historical drama series, transports viewers back in time. The series is a large-scale undertaking that was carefully assembled. The movie was beautifully filmed, and the set design is exquisite. Beautiful settings complement intricate, historically accurate costumes and set elements. The series' most significant component is its richly complex characters. The storylines of each individual are intricately intertwined, and this keeps the viewer engaged. The series' performers all do a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life. It is super best.\n",
      "Review 4473: Naseeruddin Shah does a fantastic job of making the persona cold and heartless. The music in this film is fantastic, serving as both a terrifying backdrop and a stunningly lovely accompaniment. The score, which includes the songs and the background music, enhances the film's emotional depth and overall appeal. Finally, \"Taj\" is a film that no one who enjoys epic historical dramas or thrilling action sequences should miss. The actors' pitch-perfect portrayals ensure that the film will be remembered fondly for a long time to come. This movie is really awesome. I strongly recommend to watch thiss.\n",
      "Review 4474: The trailer suggests that the film will be fantastic. My anticipation for the film is through the roof. Star after star in one movie. Aditi Rao Hydari: A Precious Gem in the Bollywood Crown! I was looking forward to reuniting with her after seeing her in Padmavat. Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah, both legendary in their own right, give a fantastic performance alongside a beautiful star ensemble. This is the kind of authentic Mughal content we've been looking for: fascinating, including a blend of established and up-and-coming actors and a plot that keeps you turning the pages. It pleases me to see that the final product appears to meet or exceed my expectations. I'm crossing my fingers for a compelling storyline with lots of twists and turns.\n",
      "Review 4475: The preview makes it look like a must-see movie. The movie has me really excited. Every major actor has one starring role. I really wanted to see Aditi rao hydari again after seeing her in Padmavat. Incredible turns from legends like Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah highlight an already stellar group. This is the genuine piece of Mughal history we've been looking for: thrilling, featuring a mix of veteran and up-and-coming actors, and boasting a storyline of exceptional quality. I'm relieved that this seems like it will live up to or perhaps exceed my expectations. I hope for a story with plenty of depth and intrigue.\n",
      "Review 4476: Strong and trustworthy screen presence. The software only operates while he is present. It is also important to know Naseeruddin Shah's name. His self-assurance and magnetism are intact. Yet, the series has already sparked a social media craze. Still, I believed there was potential for growth in the narrative. All things considered, it may not be required watching for everyone. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of Dharmendra, you should not miss this. The same holds true for Naseeruddin Shah's supporters. The reality is that drama drives the Mughal empire and related stuff in Bollywood. But, it is enjoyable, so it is not a waste of time.\n",
      "Review 4477: See the debut of Bollywood icon Dharmendra ji as he makes his first appearance in a film. Watching him perform alone merits your time. In addition to Dharmendra, Naseeruddin Shah is a must-see owing to his effortless charm and exquisite taste. Fans are already raving about the series and everything it has to offer on the internet. The plot is not horrible, but it could use some improvement. Nonetheless, fans of Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah should not miss this film under any circumstances.

      "Review 4478: This is Naseer ji at his absolute best! Unparalleled work. I look forward to each new episode very much. The actor playing Saleem is so good at his role that I initially thought he was Aditya Roy Kapoor. The film looks like it will be quite good, so I will definitely be watching it. Well done! The screenplay is fantastic, and the performances from the cast are all top-notch. I was awestruck by every single performance. Dharmendra makes a brief appearance as well. I've seen Dharam Paji twice now, and I can identify him just by the energy he exudes and the words he uses. The series will almost certainly be binge-watched in one sitting.\n",
      "Review 4479: Good and reliable on-screen presence. The program picks up steam when he's on screen. Another name to keep in mind is Naseeruddin Shah. He still has all of his cool and swagger. In addition to all of this, the series has already taken the social media by storm. The storyline, in my opinion, might have been improved. All things considered, not everyone might feel compelled to see it. Therefore, Dharmendra fans shouldn't pass up this opportunity. Supporters of Naseeruddin Shah might be compared to them. Indeed, Bollywood's Mughal empire and associated material are driven by drama. Yet it's fun and worthwhile of your time.\n",
      "Review 4480: I learned about this web series from a buddy after a very long time. He informed me that fans may easily see it because it is carried on Zee 5. I saw this web series last night, and it is full of anxiety. I think that everyone should see this web series since every actor did a fantastic job in this film. All the characters did a great job acting. It's excellent to have in-depth understanding of Indian history, and I want to acknowledge that. I want to congratulate them on a job well done.

      "Review 4481: Excellent series of OTT yet. Loved the story, camera work, music and especially Aditi Rao Haidari.The dialogue delivery of Nasir & Dharmendra Sir at this age is also so strong and effective. The show has a great set of new comers like the guy who is playing Daniyal has great sense of acting and has a hold on every scene. The sets are grand and the shot taking is very different. The best part is also the background score for every situation which gives a great feel for the overall scene. The war in the 2nd episode looks outstanding it shows the hardwork that must have gone into shooting and the VFX part is too good , What I liked the most about Taj were the characters and actors. I am looking forward to Season 2 soon .Cheers üíêüòä\n",
      "Review 4482: Game of Thrones was fictional and was everyone's favorite, but Taj is real a must watch Indian Webseries. Character of Salim is one of the best in this series (similar to John Snow in Game of Thrones). The history which was taught in school was incomplete and incorrect which we knew. The relationship between Salim & Anarkali is not shown much in the series. The story is mainly about Taj (Throne). One will be shock after watching this series once you know who Anarkali actually was, her relation with Akbar & Salim, why Birbal left Akbar, how Salim lived after Anarkali. By the end of Season 2, one will also come to know who was Shahjahan.\n",
      "Review 4483: Taj's cinematography is amazing, and it contributes to the overall tone of the picture. It's fantastic, and it fits right in with the rest of the action. I'll keep thinking about Divided By Blood once the series concludes. Everyone should watch at least one episode of the television drama Divided By Blood. Taj: Divided by Blood's production design is fairly good quality, which helps to the overall impression that the game is more realistic. The plot moves at an ideal speed, never moving too slowly or too rapidly. The character development is handled skillfully and creates a sense of completion.\n",
      "Review 4484: Naseer ji at his very best! Excellent performance. I look forward to viewing each episode of these shows. Because to his superb performance, I immediately confused the guy who portrays Saleem for Aditya Roy Kapoor. The film looks to be of good quality, and I intend to see it. Great work The screenplay is fantastic, and all of the actors are fantastic. Every single one of them blew me away with their performances. Dharmendra makes a brief appearance. It's Dharam Paji; I've seen him twice now and recognize him based on his aura and the words he uttered. The excellent series will almost certainly be viewed in its entirety in a single sitting.\n",
      "Review 4485: Naseeruddin Shah as Emperor Akbar and Dharmendra as Shaikh Salim Chisti both give outstanding performances as the film's leading protagonists. The supporting cast is just as strong, with each performer giving their role a lot of nuance and complexity. The show is both enjoyable and informative. It sheds light on India's illustrious history, which is typically overlooked by the media. Contemporary topics including religious tolerance, cultural diversity, and political aspiration are also discussed on the show. Anyone interested in Indian history and historical plays should definitely check out Taj Divided By Blood & Others.\n",
      "Review 4486: Discovering the Mughal Empire with this series will be a fantastic chance. I believe I am about to witness something genuine on the TV. Everyone's hard work in front of and behind the camera paid off amazingly well!!!! Dharam Sir's Rise to Power. I will definitely be a viewer of this program. Dharam baba, Naseer bhai, and Aditi Rao hydari are to thank for this. An innovative retelling of the story of Salim Anarkali. I've never seen anything like it before. It's a radical change of pace from the normal Bollywood fare, and it's rather grim. Discover which faction decides to stage the next protest.\n",
      "Review 4487: Naseer ji was in top form. Excellent work. Each episode of these shows has my eager anticipation.

Excellent work The film's script is fantastic, and the acting is superb throughout. Every single one of them gave a performance that left me in awe. , including a guest appearance by Dharmendra. I've seen Dharam Paji twice, and between his aura and the words he's spoken, I can easily identify him. Fantastic series, and I intend to watch all of it in one sitting so I can get the full tale.\n",
      "Review 4488: The epic historical drama series Taj Divided By Blood & Others will take viewers back in time. This series is a massive production that was obviously carefully planned and executed. The picture looks great and was shot in a very professional manner, and the set design is one of the main reasons for that. All of the locations are breathtaking, and the costumes and set decor are meticulously accurate to the time period. The show's characters are its most compelling component because of how intricate and multifaceted they are.

      "Review 4489: The opportunity to study the Mughal Empire in this subject is invaluable. My suspicion is that I'm going to see something real on TV. The effort of everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera, is clearly visible!!!! The rise of Dharam Sir. That's a show that I'll be tuning in to. It's the fault of Dharam paaji, Naseer sir, and Aditi Rao hydari. A new angle on the Salim Anarkali saga. What you just described is the first of its kind that I have ever encountered. It's rather dark and depressing compared to the usual Bollywood fare. Find out who will be protesting next. I like it is very.\n",
      "Review 4490: The lead actors, particularly Naseeruddin Shah as Emperor Akbar and Dharmendra as Shaikh Salim Chisti, give outstanding performances. The rest of the cast is just as impressive, with each member adding new layers of nuance and complexity to their respective roles. This show is not only fun to watch, but it also teaches valuable lessons. It enlightens the public on India's illustrious history, which is frequently ignored by the media. Tolerance of different faiths, cultural differences, and political aspirations are among topics that are discussed in the show. Any fan of historical dramas or Indian history should definitely check out Taj Divided By Blood & Others.\n",
      "Review 4491: ExcellentI really like the way everyone is looking. The surprise element was watching Dharmendra sir in this attire.

      "Review 4492: Indications of the film's potential are made in the preview. I can't wait to go watch the film. All the big names in Hollywood are in one film. After seeing Aditi Rao Hydari in Padmavat, I was hoping to catch a glimpse of her in another film. She is a precious gem. Outstanding performances come from the whole cast, but especially from Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah. This is exactly the type of engaging, historically accurate, and entertaining programming about the Mughals that we've been waiting for. The screenplay is fantastic, and the cast is a wonderful mix of seasoned actors and promising newcomers.

Very hard effort has been put in by those both in front of and behind the camera. Sir Dharam's meteoric rise. Definitely something I'd tune in to. Dharam paaji, Naseer sir, and Aditi Rao hydari deserve all the praise in the world. This is a fascinating take on the Salim Anarkali legend. For me, this is the first time anything like this has happened. It's really different from the normal Bollywood fare, and it's a lot of downer. Choose the next set of protesters.\n",
      "Review 4494: See the renowned Bollywood idol Dharmendra ji make his big screen debut as he commands the screen with his commanding presence. His performance alone is well worth the time you'll spend watching. Together with Dharmendra, Naseeruddin Shah is a must-watch due to his equally notable easy charm and flair. The acclaim for this series and everything it has to offer is already pouring in from all corners of social media. Yet even while the storyline isn't terrible, there's still space for growth. Although it may not be a must-watch for everyone, it is a must-see for ardent Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah fans.\n",

      "Review 4508: Season 1 is gripping, the bloodshed is irksome but overall the show is engaging. It's important that the creators focus their attention on some of the less discussed characters - Salim's 2nd and 3rd wives. The chief consort cannot be more important than the wives. Dharmendra ji, Naseeruddin Shah, Sandhya Mridul, and Aashim Gulati keep the viewers emotionally invested with their good performances. The dialogues need more improvisation and dialogue delivery, characterisation and presentation of Salim needs more depth. With the death of Akhbar, the creators have a lot of work to do regarding the viewers' engagement perspective. Screenplay and dialogues are key requirements.\n",

The supporting ensemble is likewise excellent. With each performer lending their characters depth and complexity. The program is not only entertaining to watch, but it also educates. It sheds light on India and its rich past, which is often overlooked by mainstream media. The program also examines current issues such as religious tolerance, cultural diversity, and political ambition. Ultimately, Taj Divided By Blood & Others is essential viewing for anybody interested in historical plays or Indian history.\n",
      "Review 4511: I saw the 5 episodes of taj and must say it's a very very well written show. The way the characters are looking and they have performed is making this show look so different. The cinematography is standing out also the shot taking is not like any regular show. The hardwork is visible with the details that are shown in the show. Looking forward to the other episodes as the story gets interesting from this point and I am too eager to know where will this go. It was a pleasure to watch dharmendra paji after so long. He still has the same hold in his performance even at this age. Kudos to the creator.\n",
      "Review 4512: Amazing picturization by the world famous director. Loved his work and way he presents the whole story for the throne and the one who really deserves it. Some facts were really surprising and new to me as compare to the Mughals stories we have been watching since our childhood. I was not the great fan of Nasruddin shah's acting but this time he nailed it with his phenomenal performance as the great Mughal king Akbar. On the other side Aditi Rao Hydari did fabulous job by showing her fantastic acting and dance skills. I am eagerly waiting for the next season of this race of the throne. Please atleast let me know the date of releasing the next season. Great job. Taj rocks .\n",
      "Review 4513: Bollywood icon Dharmendra Ji makes his film debut here. Even if you don't get anything else out of it, just going to see him perform is worth it. In addition to Dharmendra, Naseeruddin Shah is well admired for his effortless charisma and refined taste in fashion. There has been a recent surge of praise for this series online. Storytelling isn't always a negative art form. Highly recommended for fans of Naseeruddin Shah and Dharmendra, although others may choose to pass. Bollywood movies on the Mughal Empire tend to focus more on spectacle than historical accuracy, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy them.\n",

      "Review 4515: The Internet debut of Bollywood legend Dharmendra Ji may be found right here. His efforts are fruitful. Consistently commanding presence on screen. In fact, he improves the show for the whole company. In addition, Naseeruddin Shah is a someone worth watching. There has been no change in his air of casual cool. Social media users are going crazy with the show. Narrative-wise, I think it might have been stronger, but it wasn't terrible. In the end, it's possible that it's not a must-see for everyone. Nonetheless, Dharmendra fans shouldn't miss it. Those who support Naseeruddin Shah might be accused of the same thing. Still, I hope you like it.\n",

His swagger and coolness are intact. Furthermore, the series has already been a massive hit across social media platforms. I think the plot could have used some work. It's possible that some people won't feel the need to go. So, those who like Dharmendra's work shouldn't miss this chance. Their likeness might be drawn to Naseeruddin Shah's supporters. Undoubtedly, drama is what propels the Mughal empire and related content in Bollywood. In spite of that, it's entertaining and well worth your time.\n",

I really like this movie.i am watching 2 time this movie......highly recommend to watch all guys.\n",
      "Review 4560: The trailer gives a taste of what the film will provide. I'm dying to see the movie. Each famous actor only appears in one film. After witnessing Aditi Rao Hydari in Padmavat, I was excited to see her in another film. She's a real gem, that one. Among the stellar cast, Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah stand out with particularly impressive turns. This has the authentic plot, established performers, and promising newcomers that we've been looking for about the Mughal era. I'm relieved to report that initial impressions of this production have been positive. I'm crossing my fingers that the tale they tell is interesting and complex.\n",
      "Review 4561: Maximum Naseer ji! You did a fantastic job. I look forward to the next episode in these series. I initially thought the actor playing Saleem was Aditya Roy Kapoor because of how well he played the role. The film seems great, and I can't wait to see it. Excellent effort All of the actors do an excellent job, and the script is excellent as well. Every every single one of them just floored me with their incredible performances. Dharmendra has a cameo in this movie. I've met Dharam Paji twice and am familiar with him through his presence and what he's said. You can count on seeing the full series in one sitting.\n",
      "Review 4562: This series might be a great resource for learning about the Mughal Empire. My guess is that soon the screen will display actual content. Those in front of and behind the camera have put forth a lot of effort. Sir Dharam's Ascension to the Throne. I will definitely tune in to this show. Everyone should thank Dharam Paaji, Naseer Sir, and Aditi Rao Hydari. Another interpretation of the story of Salim Anarkali. It's the first time I've seen anything like that. That's a drastic change from the typical Bollywood fare, and it's really melancholy. What group of protesters do you think will emerge next?\n",
      "Review 4563: The show is representative of the high level of originality and skill typical of Indian cinema. Furthermore, it reflects the extensive and diverse cultural traditions that exist inside India today. It's an excellent piece of art that deserves every bit of acclaim it has received. The historical epic \"Taj\" is large and visually stunning. The film, directed by Ron Scalpello and shot in a cinematic way, tells a grand story. There are some breathtakingly gorgeous sequences in this film. The ornate set and lavish costumes transport viewers to another era. Naseeruddin Shah gives a fantastic performance as Akbar.\n",
      "Review 4564: The story line does not add up with age of characters and the actual dateline of the historical events that are refered to. It stretches unnecessarily for long time. Some of the actors are really good. Nasseruddin Shah looks too old to be playing a 42/43 year compared to the time when Salim married to Maan Bai. Not sure why such a legend would decide to be a part of such a baseless project. The series ends with a possibility of a second season which would be possibly be centred around Salim's revenge. Hope the producers take heed to this message and refrain from creating another torturous season.\n",
      "Review 4565: The teaser makes the film look fantastic. Seeing the movie is on my list of must-dos. The movie has an ensemble cast of A-listers. Stunning actress Aditi Rao Hydari! I wanted to see her again after watching Padmavat. Dharmendra and Naseeruddin Shah, two legends in their own right, lead a great cast that includes many other A-listers and turn in excellent performances. We want more stuff like this, which is authentically set in Mughal times, has great acting from both established and newcomer performers, and has a great screenplay. I'm glad to see that the program seems to live up to or perhaps beyond my high hopes. I'm anticipating an interesting and well-developed plot.\n",
      "Review 4566: The film's amazing atmosphere is largely due to Taj's cinematography. Fantastic, and it fits right along with the rest of the action. Once the last episode of Split By Blood airs, I know I'll still be thinking about it. Each person should watch at least one episode of the show Divided By Blood. Taj: Split by Blood has a more realistic feel because to its superior production design. The story moves at the perfect pace, never lagging or speeding up. One's expectations are exceeded by the expert handling of character development. The peaceful coexistence of the show's characters makes Taj: Divided By Blood a pleasant viewing experience. Taj: Split By Blood is a fantastic example of how different genres of stories can coexist in the same volume. The characters and their plights in Taj: Divided by Blood captivated me throughout the story. I was completely engrossed in Divided by Blood and its fascinating story because of the excellent writing by Taj. That was a fantastic adventure, and I think everyone should watch Taj: Divided By Blood.\n",
      "Review 4567: Naseeruddin Shah does an excellent job of conveying the character's callousness and lack of compassion. One of the film's greatest strengths is its score, which manages to be both horrifying and stunningly beautiful. The music, which includes both songs and score, adds to the film's emotional depth and general appeal. Whether you like big historical dramas or lots of action, \"Taj\" is a film you won't want to miss. The performers' outstanding performances ensure that this picture will be talked about for years to come. The Mughal Empire is shown in this series superbly. I hope the television shows I watch are based on reality. A lot of hard work has gone into this from everyone in front of and behind the camera. Rising of Sir Dharam to power. Without a doubt, I will tune in to this show. All the credit goes to Dharam paaji, Naseer sir, and Aditi Rao hydari. Totally new take on the Salim Anarkali myth. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. That is very dark and different from the usual Bollywood fare. Find out who will be in charge of the next protest.\n",

      "Review 4569: At this point, Naseer ji is performing at the top of his game. This was a fantastic showing. I look forward to the next episode in these series. At first, I thought the guy playing Saleem was actually Aditya Roy Kapoor because of how well he played the role. The trailer made the film look really good, so I'll probably end up seeing it. Excellent effort The storyline is excellent, and the performances are all top-notch. Each and every one of you gave a performance that just floored me. Dharmendra appears in a brief cameo role. Dharam Paji, whom I have met twice previously and can now identify by his presence and what he says alone. Such a magnificent series will almost certainly be seen in its entirety in a single sitting.\n",
      "Review 4570: *Simply Spectacular*Nicely shot! Brilliant actors, Naeeruddin Shah as Akbar >>> , all characters have there own trajectory which is ultimately connected! Murad played by Taha Shah Badussha is absolutely fantastic in his performance and does absolute justice to the role . Man Singh played by Digambar Prasad is my personal favourite character in the series loyal to his king, Badshah and Saltanat are his first choices. Salim played by Gulati is a Prince material! Aditi Rao Hydari also known as Anarkali is saga of beauty! New debutant Shubham Kumar Mehra has done a good job. This is the best series if you like periodic tales. I give 9.5 stars out of 10.\n",
      "Review 4571: I saw Dharmendra Paanji on screen after a long time and he nailed it like as always before. Being a roto artist I feel proud by working in this series and I am glad to part of it .Overall series was awesome. Casting, story line,custom design awesome. Background music scores are perfectly composed.most characters are worked well. Aditi Rao looking so gorgeous. Gain some historical knowledge. Naseeruddin shah sir , Rahul Bose ,Padma damodaram,pankaj Saraswat, Deepraj Rana are worked so good. Ian arbar make awsome music. Ian arbar u make me ur fan. Super cinemagraphic awsome must watch once don't miss it.\n",
      "Review 4572: As story of epic proposition with so many twist, have to compliment to the directer, creative team for showing us a war that I have never seen on Indian cinema love story is also great. Really like the way everyone is waching the series the surprise element was watching Dharmendra as in role of sekh salim chisty. The show has great set of new comers like the new guy who's playing daniyal character has great acting sence and hold on every seen in the entired series. The best part is also the background score for every situation which gives a great feel for the over all series. The hard work that must have gone into shooting and the Vfx of the series is great.\n",
      "Review 4573: I really like the way everyone is looking. The surprise element was watching Dharmendra sir in this attire. The dialogue delivery of sir at this age is also so strong and effective. The show has a great set of new comers like the guy who is playing Daniyal has great sense of acting and has a hold on every scene. The sets are grand and the shot taking is very different. The best part is also the background score for every situation which gives a great feel for the overall scene. The war in the 2nd episode looks outstanding it shows the hardwork that must have gone into shooting and the VFX looks nice too.\n",
      "Review 4574: Have to say Taj : Divided by blood was even better than I expected and I was expecting it to be good! Especially after reading all the great reviews and ratings. What a masterpiece and work of epic scale. Mughal story that I never knew about. Great story, great casting, lovely direction. Must watch Aashim Gulati As ( Salim )And Taha Shah Badussha as (Murad). Playing Best Roles Ever. If you're looking for a good Historical Series that will hold your attention throughout every episode then give this a try. You won't be disappointed. Excellent show. Loved the story, camera work, music and especially anarkali. So beautiful, so delicate. Aditi was thePlay Anarkali. Very different take to an age old story. Kudos to the director.\n",

My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending. What a show. This one looks grand. Saw the first 3 Episodes looking forward for the rest of it. Great way of knowing about the unknown facts of history. The story, the cast, the vfx, the shot taking is so different. I don't think I have seen anything of this level in the ott platform before.Vfx work is excellent, Sets looks GrandWar scenes are super & full of actionLots of shocking & unknown facts in history about moghal empower truly entertaining series, love the cast specialy Salim & AnarkaliCharacter.\n",

Loved the story, camera work, music and especially anarkali. So beautiful, so delicate with no make up. Aditi was the perfect choice to Play Anarkali. What I liked the most about Taj were the characters and actors. What I hated most about Taj was that it ended. I believe there is a season 2 also.What a masterpiece and work of epic scale. Mughal story that I never knew about. Great story, great casting, lovely direction. Must watchA story of epic proposition with so many twists. Have to compliment the director for showing us a war that I have never seen on Indian cinema. Take a bow.\n",
      "Review 4578: This series might not be factual correct but it's very engaging and entertaining, I believe we cannot actually cross check whether the narrative is accurate or not but if you talk about different perspective you will find it very interesting... Good watch over weekend. Fall in love with all the characters and amazing acting skills which will provoke many emotions. Series is not dragged but tries to create strong emotions with all the characters be it positive or negative. Also this series has nothing to do with any kind of image build for mughal empires. If you liked watch Game of thrones this is kind of similar.\n",
      "Review 4579: This series will keep you on your toes, very well scripted, well structure and beautifully portrayed. Casting is so awesome, that after some time you get into a feeling that they are real. You will fall in love with chemistry of Salim-Anarkali, Aditi Rao looks stunning - fabulous, great background music for her..make you fall in love with Anarkali. Salim-Aashim Gulati has done a fabulous work, has bright future for sure. Akbar- Birbal Naseerji-Subodh bhave chemistry is nicely shown, respect they have for each other, conversations occurred among them. Every actor has definitely justified their own character which will not make you bore. Series is made so engaging that you will keep on running the episode till entire season ends üòú\n",

      "Review 4582: Boy o boy...What a brilliant piece of art this series is!!!! A true homage to the Indian legends who selflessly shaped our country's bright future for what it is today. Due credit to the writers for making this 'know your heroes' series most entertaining to watch. Fantastic performance from all the actors involved including the phenomenal acting by Jim Sarbh in leading role, it would be unfair for other actors to say that he stole every scene that he was in but Damn he NAILED IT!!The dialogues had wits where needed with engaging story and direction was top notch by Abhay Pannu. Cinematography was also good.More like this one Please?\n",
      "Review 4583: An enriching tale of 2 great men on whose shoulders our country's technology sector is standing. If you ever wanted to look back into history and understand how a country which was stripped down, starved and exploited in every possible way for 200 years was able to stand again, have its own space program and a nuclear weapon - watch this show to understand how it all started. The sacrifices made by them is bearing fruits now. The actors are as good as they come. Direction is top class. The only lag are episode 2 and 3 where the romantic track take the seat. Do yourself a favour and watch it. We rarely make such piece of art.\n",
      "Review 4584: Excellent series with amazing display of extraordinary lives of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and DrHomi bhabha.Jim sarabh for outstanding performance by jim sarabh..It's a must watch!\n",
      "Review 4585: This is probably one of those rare times that after finishing the seris, I am craving for few more episodes. This was such an engaging and enjoyable watch, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout, although the genre is not thriller. This is the best that could have been dedicated to 3 of the greatest scientists of India, Dr. Homi J. Bhabha, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and (initial days of) Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. The series showcases both their personal and professional lives very well. Jim Sarbh was mind blowingly superb, Ishwak Singh, Rajit Kapur, Dibyendu Bhattacharya and Regina Cassandra all did perfectly well too. Perhaps the title wasn't the most appropriate one as this was not just about rocket launch, it was about atomic energy, nuclear reactor, and so much more.\n",
      "Review 4586: Acting: acting done by each actor in this series is exceptional.Storyline: Best part about the storyline is they tried to connect the puzzle the best way possible it starts with a rivalry between Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai including the characters like CV Raman, JRD Tata and APJ Abdul Kalam. Even though it looks like a rivalry but in this series you will see how both of them tried to build a strong foundation for India in either building space rockets or be it building Atom bombs.I am very sure during the end of this series you will be left with patriotic feeling in your heart. #BharatMataKiJai.\n",
      "Review 4587: I think this maybe breakthrough performance of Jim Sarbh. I was hooked from the start when I almost randomly clicked on this show and it started playing.\n",
      "Review 4588: Trust me you will feel proud about everything these series has shown. Each moment each character has played their part with pure brilliance. Need more series like this for our generation to enlighten us about those brave men..üëå\n",
      "Review 4589: Legendary series quite slow in its pace but the concluding episodes were makes a lasting impact. Both leads were great and not to mention the appearance of DR APJ Abdul Kalam. A decent and captivating experience.\n",
      "Review 4590: Both lead are perfect, acting is top notch throughout the series, from background score to DOP everything is great.But forced addition of love stories wasn't necessary, with minimal time for that they could've moved on and added more material but they've pulled the bollywood there, otherwise it was pure 9/10.And Loved the last 3 episodes that only because there is no bollywood-yappa in them.\n",
      "Review 4591: RocketBoys on SonyLIV is a masterpiece! Beautifully written, brilliantly cast, spectacularly shot, skillfully executed in every department. Special mention to the music of Achint Thakkar and Jim Sarbh is my new favourite! All will be swept by him! What acting!Amazing performance by everyone. Can't wait for season 2 ..\n",
      "Review 4592: When you do a biopic, make sure you give credit to all the characters. Meghnad Saha did his education from India coming from a small village and contributed immensely to astrophysics.But the makers decided to change his name to show a communal angle in the web series. That is manipulation and should be called out.\n",
      "Review 4593: In my opinion, this is what i want on OTT because we didn't well aware about our science heros so that's the best way to introduce with india new Generation. Good work keep going.\n",
      "Review 4594: I write very few reviews and I just could not hold back from writing a review for this show. It's amazing especially for history buffs like me to know the events and the historical figures upclose and know about their circumstances and what they went through to achieve impossible targets with limited budgets and resources. This is factually accurate and shows the reality in a sophisticated way. This show does not have the usual bollywood over the top vibe and that makes it more appealing. Kudos to Jim Sarbh & Ishwak Singh for staying true to their portrayals. The way they were acting in the show was superb. A must watch for every Indian.\n",
      "Review 4595: Its a phenomenal series highlighting the coming of age of Indian science and contribution to our current development. We need more such series from the current crop of director and script writers. With emphasis on our recent history with a more nuanced take.\n",
      "Review 4596: So far the best Indian series without any doubt....First of all it's a true story with bit of drama added for obvious reasons...but nothing extra...being an Indian all must know the tremendous work out scientists did and the sacrifice they made to build modern India....Direction is almost flawless...BGM is superb which is rare in Indian serieses .. we can easily recollect GOT or Sherlock BGM but not that much for Indian serieses..Rocket Boys theme music can change that...Acting is just awesome...Jim Sarbh is already a lagend for me...nobody can portray Homi Bhabha better that him surely...Ultimately it's a roller coster of emotion, pride and thrill.... A master piece!!!\n",

      "Review 4600: This is until now the best series about unexplored area of the Indian History. Very good story and screenplay. The team should work with Doordarshan to show this series on state television, that much importance it has. Even school should arrange shows for it for their students.Starting from the Bhabha to Kalam ,it has everything and Second season should take the story forward.\n",
      "Review 4601: I dont really watch webseries and i was a fan of science fiction but this webseries gives me another sides of the world. Acting of all were great but a little lengthy and it should as it supposed to contain pre and after indian independence.Dr. Homi bhabha, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Dr. A. P.

      "Review 4604: Have anyone seen such aberration from any other production house where an reenactment of real historical facts where fictionsal character like Raza just added to spice up the story !Had it been declared as fictions adopted from partial historical facts with character names changed still could get an excuse.

Disgusted and should be sued by India Government.\n",
      "Review 4605: Made you feel the bygone era. Need more Indian series on varied subjects like this. Love the originality and freshness with which nationalism was potrayed.\n",
      "Review 4606: Watched numerous american representations of their history, financial institutions and scientific advancements and was greatly moved by those docuseries.This is the first time I see an Indian representation which is so engrossing and not straying miles away from the truth. A wonderful webseries of great scientific minds battling out the various odds to establish scientific institutions and scientific culture in early stages of independent India.Somehow the scientific trajectory was lost in the lanes of political aspirations of people and we are still playing catch up with the West. Whatever the little we have is the result of great battle of these men. A will written webseries carefully balancing the political environment of the time and science.\n",
      "Review 4607: First 3 episodes are filled with unnecessary drama. The screenplay apart from laboratory scenes appear to be completely asynchronous. Dialogues are modernistic. Sarabhai's lovestory made me pukish. Will be back after watching the rest.\n",
      "Review 4608: 1st 3 episodes are just about marriage and other Masalas. Bollywood typical.These were real people. But dialogues are scripted like, for some Bollywood movie character.

Jim Sarbh and Ishwak Singh as great scientists Dr Homi Bhabha and Dr Vikram Sarabhai did a commendable job.The story was laid beautifully with the struggles faced by these greats in creating history along with an amazing supporting cast as well. Although I would have loved if there were few more episodes, Rocket Boys completes the life of these pioneers within 8 episodes with quite magnificence.My Rating : 8/10.\n",

      "Review 4614: A story every Indian should know about. It begins with a slow pace and picks up after the first half. Which means it gets interesting almost after 4 episodes. It focuses on the life of two of the greatest minds of our country- Homi Jahangir Bhabha and Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai. The acting is good but somehow we don't feel very much connected to the characters due to which this one feels weak and I guess they had showed it in more detail, only then this would have clicked more. Still it is a good historical experience.\n",

Jim Sarbh & Ishwak Singh Have Played Their Respective Parts With Aplomb... They Are Too Good As Homi Jehangir Bhabha & Vikram Sarabhai...

      "Review 4623: Rocket Boys is a great web series that portrays the incredible life journeys of two legendary Indian scientists, Homi J Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai.The show is set in the 1940s to the 1960s, during India's independence struggle and beyond. The show's visuals transport viewers back in time, with the use of 35mm reels from the 1950s adding to the authentic feel. It portrays the two scientists' personal and professional lives, highlighting their ambitions, egos, personal struggles, and scientific achievements. One of the best things about Rocket Boys is the amount of research and attention to detail that has gone into the show.Overall, Rocket Boys is a must-watch for anyone interested in science and India's development in the field. It's a fascinating portrayal of two of India's greatest scientists, who continue to inspire our generations.\n",
      "Review 4624: What a direction and screenplay,story writing was also very nice. It's must a binge watch. Acting of Dr. Sarabhai and Dr. Homi j bhabha was impressive.Hats to all the efforts they made to make this masterpiece.Thankyou.\n",
      "Review 4625: What a wonderful series, beautifully made. The story of our greats who laid the foundation of a better, developed, scientific India. Dr. Homi J Bhabha was a legend in all terms and the way Jim Sarabh has portrayed him is absolutely amazing, I will always be his fan for this particular performance. This series makes you proud, gives goosebumps on a lot of occasions.Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam and all the greats were portrayed true to their potential. Three cheers to all the artists, the makers to bring us such stories that has inspired generations.Everything from story, to characters to the background score is perfect. Absolutely Atonished!\n",
      "Review 4626: This series caters to the needs of most viewers out there, i am going to list a few positives according to me point wise.1- boasts of immense acting prowess from the entire cast2 Casting is pitch perfect, the actors have brought the legendary characters back to life with this series.3 It shows how hard it was for our scientists to work in this politically tense country of ours dominated by self interests and family establishments4 how the strong and powerful countries took our country for granted and hindered our progress5 all science enthusiasts must watch this as there is a lot to learn from this amazing series.\n",
      "Review 4627: This Web Series Did Very Good Performance. Specially Jim Sarbh & Ishwak Singh & Dibyendu Bhattacharya & K. C. Shankar & Ragina Cassandra & Rajit Kapoor & Karthik Srinivasan & Neha Chauhan & Namit Das Did Outstanding Acting.In Season 2: it's again Very Good. Above all Cast do his/her Best.\n",
      "Review 4628: This is the most authentic and engaging show i have ever seen in india. It is based on two towering figures in Indian history. But the screenplay never treats them with flawless legendary cardboard pieces. Instead it humanises these two personas with shortcomings. The screenplay blends fiction and fact with utmost sincerity,keeping the relevant facts even today. The performances are top notch. I remember mostly Dibyendu bhattacharya. He is terrific. But others are also brilliant. The production design is awesome.\n",
      "Review 4629: Superb Set Designs, Actors, Mindblowing Backround Music. One of the best biopic series ever. I gone to that era because of Suprerb Direction and Cinematography.\n",
      "Review 4630: One of the best Indian series with finest performances and an engaging plot. Great storytelling in honouring India's greatest minds. A must watch for every Indian and all science lovers across the globe. Aspiring actors & filmmakers would love Rocket Boys!\n",
      "Review 4631: First episode gave me a bad impression of this series. Don't know what the makers tried to say. Sarabhai rejects the idea of having nuclear weapons, was that real?\n",
      "Review 4632: Undoubtedly a series that will set standard for other film maker to follow to make an International series . Congratulations .. kuddos ..Being an Actor , writer and director from small town I must congratute casting director first because in past of my life whatever facial description or body language I had studied was in front of my screen .Congratulations to All Crew and cast of Project .Thanks to makers at least the young generation will come to know about founders of Space Programme Founders Of Independent India .\n",
      "Review 4633: There's nothing good about this series except dialogues from Homi Bhabha.Unnecessary extended length. You'll always in a hope that something will be coming good in next episode but completely waste of time.We all know that who invented who and who's having contribution to the nation.There's no need to create this series!\n",
      "Review 4634: I was emotionally moved by watching both the seasons of Rocket Boys. It only reminds of how lucky we are to be living in the current era in a country like India. There has been so many sacrifices that so many great scientists, people from the armed forces, politicians, farmers, researchers have made for this country. We take it all for granted. All the actors have given splendid performances. The direction is awesome and story telling is very gripping. Background music is so apt. I wish all the best to the entire crew. It move to back to those time and felt that i was there while the life events were happening. If only people learn to respect all these sacrifices and also the freedom that they are enjoying now.\n",
      "Review 4635: The performances are excellent. Jim Sarbh and Ishwak Singh are both excellent as Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai, respectively. They bring the characters to life and make them incredibly relatable.The show is well-researched and accurate. The writers did a lot of research to ensure that the show was as accurate as possible, both in terms of the historical events and the characters themselves.If you're looking for a well-made, inspiring, and educational show about two remarkable men who made significant contributions to India's scientific development, then I highly recommend checking out Rocket Boys.\n",
      "Review 4636: The story narrated is beautiful. The charcters played are lovely. This series is truly inspiring and must watch for every citizen of india to know our scientific past of democratic india and challenges we faced. Through this series we will know the young minds of india in building our present. I just that everyone should see this with patience.\n",
      "Review 4637: Story of two of the greatest scientists India ever had. Rocket boys is an amazingly entertaining watch which gives us a great insight into those times. Please don't be fooled into thinking this will be some boring preachy show, this is as good as it gets in terms of entertainment. While almost everything about the series is top notch, want to mention three things that stand out for me.1. Jim Sarb gives a performance for ages. This is definitely his best and one of the best seen on Indian screen in recent times2. Background score is riveting and apt3. Dialogue are too notch and make every scene worth watching.\n",
      "Review 4638: I was very excited to watch a show about Indian scientists from a critical time in a critical situation. It is a docudrama with some desi thadka. The docu part is fine but the drama part was typical. I encourage creative liberty but most of the times it becomes bollywood-esque. In this case it's not too much but I'm just sick of it at this point. Dialogues come about how audience expect them to be rather than what they should be. Romance was yet again portrayed poorly. There is unnecessary exaggeration here and there. I'd prefer ISRO podcast on Spotify which was dramatized too with Harsha Bogle's narration. Apart from some sloppy writing, acting was good and I could see that effort was put in intro, audio and set.\n",
      "Review 4639: Great plot, beautiful story, easy to understand!Feels good to see a story appreciating the advances of science while capturing the ethos of a young Independent India. MUST WATCH!\n",
      "Review 4640: The content is so deep that you cant blink your eyes for once. Ishwak and Jim are outstanding. All time it gives a feeling, that how courageous and strong head people werein India,Due to them we are able to see so many inventions in India. I must say Director has minutely worked on all the characters of series. Going forward I expect more science based series. The character of Raza Mehndi done by Dibyendu Bhattacharya is excellent. He was the one having grey shade but still nice person. The words are less to write about this webseries but feelings towards series is infinite. Abhay Pannu i request, please direct more series like this.\n",
      "Review 4641: Ohh around 60years ago f..k word is so common to use. I mean an educated scientist using such cheap language, kissing in front of public , Sarabhai became Devdas .Bollywood really lacking with content so Bajirao ,Sarabhai all became neshedi for woman . Shameful thing. Those who wrote script, directed it why afraid to show congress real face .\n",
      "Review 4642: It was worth watching rocket boys the music the action and it took us the exactly at the moment present among the geniusesThe plot everything was totally worth the excitement to wait forBrilliant series.\n",
      "Review 4643: In my child days I was thinking why Bollywood is not making movies on our historical person's. Now I am taking back my words, Bollywood should not make historical movies.This is digital era. Every one knows the history read's history.But Bollywood is thinking nobody knows history. What ever we do they will see. Stop it.\n",
      "Review 4644: It deserves this. It might not be mindblowing but shows the legends of our history in an appropriate way and music is so godamn good i love it . The cast is great and their performace is perfecy. Its one of the best indian web series of all and another masterpiece created by sonyliv. There are many problems like inconsistent narrative and not so massy theme but i loved it. This focuses more on the emotional side of the main character instead of the science but 2nd season is even better. This series is clearly a must watch for those who want to watch something good. The music feels fresh and i did not even dkipped it intro music a single time. Fully recommended by me.\n",
      "Review 4645: I had high expectations from the series however, it is too damn slow. I was expecting some fast faced biopic about our scientific bulwarks but got a boring 40's love story with mediocre dialogues. The director slowed the plot so much and focussed on love stories or some party events. First 4 episodes were a big drag. Avoid but if you must watch, start from the 6th episode. Only the last 3 episodes have actual interesting events about nuclear reactor or space program.\n",
      "Review 4646: I have read about Homi Bhabha; learnt about Vikram Sarabhai...after all Vikram was the name of the Chandrayaan lander. But seeing them in a visual manner was a different experience. I can say I loved it. The ease with which the actors have showcased the brilliant lives of some of the great scientists that India has produced is commendable. I particularly liked Arjun Radhakrishnan as Kalam. I believe that watching this series is not a matter of choice but rather a moral compulsion to be a better judge of what it means to be a good cinema.\n",
      "Review 4647: Such an important, intriguing theme. The script is not bad at all and available in multiple languages. But it's marred by oh-so-momentous acting as if it's a high school play, and to make matters worse, raucous music that's suppose to shrill and thrill every other minute. Distracting to the point of making one want to take a break. Could have been a great show but the 9.4 rating (desi crowds hard at work) is undeserved.\n",
      "Review 4648: The series starts off well but loses the plot completely for me as they delve into the romance between Vikram and Mrinalini. It was distracting and bored me to death to be brutally honest.I had to stop watching the show after being invested for 5 episodes and it is shame because the actors' performances were brilliant.\n",
      "Review 4649: Must watch this series. Truly democratic and inspiringIn building the young nation india after independence. All the characters are phenomenaul .Must watch.\n",
      "Review 4650: One of the best series Bollywood has ever produced the plot , character building, acting, music & direction were flawless and above all it's a story of unsung heroes to whom we owe our modern India and future of many coming generations............... We want to know more about these leaders.\n",
      "Review 4651: Every second is worth watching!! Each character is filled real heroes... Too inspiring for any patriot!! I am sure many such series will be coming in the future.. The series will have a lasting memories!!\n",
      "Review 4652: While the story is good, it's a pain for eyes. I'm wondering why every scene is shot in dark. Were they saving electricity bill or trying to portray that those were the dark days of humanity. Complete nonsensical.\n",
      "Review 4653: First of all i thank to director of rocket boys.such wonderful series it is..I really feel proud that 3 mad scientist and his team makes Indias future..i am waiting for next season..I want to tell all my Brother and sisters to watch this series..to feel proud. Jitana bhi kahu utna kam hi hay..Dr homi and vikram sarabhai are gems of India. Decision maker,in adverse situation they work hardly and courageously. Thank u once again .. Cast of series is too good..way to present is really really good..,Script ,music,drama,camera action is really good.\n",
      "Review 4654: Firstly, I'm thankful to the production house for creating this series. Its very rare to find series made on Indian geniuses. Excellent work by each and every actor. There is suspense, drama, historical events depiction and inspiring scenes. You'll feel so proud of our scientists and understand that all that we take for granted for now (live tv streaming for example) was so hard to achieve. BARC ISRO DRDO PSLV etc are such common words now but they have such a tough and enriched history and the series has done such good justice to it. Season 1 and 2 combined covers such a long arc of historical events both in indian development in science and politics without feeling it strectched at any point that it needs to special applause for the director and editor's work. I hope more and more people watch this series and more such series are created in the future. Must watch.\n",
      "Review 4655: The best series in recent time to depict the real culture of Indian scientists community covering all the aspects around them, can't wait to see the next season.\n",
      "Review 4656: Ka banaye ho bhaia , Rocket science kam textile business with ashiqui jyada lagta hai,Hum ye soch ke thoda Rocket science ke liye uttezit honge , yaha sala ashiqui Sikh liya,Thoda bohot homi bhaia ka role acha laga,Ek kam q nhi karte title change kar so Cosmic boys kuchüôÑüòï\n",
      "Review 4657: It's good too see now India is leading at OTT platform and making Masterpiece Webseries. Totally Worth to watch it. And yeah it explains the journey of How difficult for India to make a Atom bomb and the story of Vikram sarabai, Home bhaba, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.\n",
      "Review 4658: There's no series matching this one.I'd rather die but not stop watching this on repeat.It's not just about knowing history but also about the culture and the things that our country has achieved due to the visionary leadership and scientists we had. Please watch this and don't miss it.Just Wowwwww.\n",
      "Review 4659: This is a typical Bollywood type masala attempt.This series has everything starting from drama, love twists, politics, unions and their strike.Only thing that is missing from the plot is \"Science\" that one would expect from the series based on the likes of Bhabha and Sarabhai.These halfwits from Bollywood have a knack of picking greatest Indic story lines and screwing them left, right and center..Least said about this the better.. I am seething with rage.\n",
      "Review 4660: Wow.. what a creation, this is really best every web series created, we need to go in more details as few are sensitive information, but no harm this is new India we want to watch the truth... Kudos to actors, screen play, timings, editing, it creates connection, 10 on 10 must watch web series.\n",
      "Review 4661: I dont understand how come its 9 !!! I feel Movie is too slow, and not also much entertaining. I cant gv good rating just by seeing old news paper, old car, and things in old days ...For any movie with good rating, we wont get bored by watching multiple times.. you may recall some goodmovies.Now a big question - will I be able to watch this for 2nd time ? The ans is NO . I CANT ..In that case I should nt give a outstanding rating..\n",
      "Review 4662: Excellent story with best crew cast with amazing screen play very dramatical music and very connecting acting.I thought it shows to everyone and special children and science young students.Hope from this so much students and babies will be inspired for becoming great scientist of our Bharat like them.Pt. Nehru done very well for nation but our foreign policy are not upto that level due to which we loosed great personalities and government should add all these inspiration things in curriculum of every children instead of Mughals journey.Very very great and thanks to all whomes associated with this beautiful web series.\n",
      "Review 4663: Fantastic series based on simple scientists contribute to nation building with their dream and passion to achieve in any circumstances. Anyone can get motivated by this.\n",
      "Review 4664: This series is mind blowing! From Casting to Storyline to Directions to Editing! Everything is simply perfect. Lastly Jim sarbh is the steals the show!\n",
      "Review 4665: I will recommend you 1000 times this series....this is biopic of two legendary Indians who have will to create india a super power in science game......sony liv u guys just crack the actual code what india youth actually need to see first shark tank than rocket boys....brilliant stuff !!!!\n",
      "Review 4666: Such a wonderful series which focusses the life of revolutionary scientists that India ever had in its history. What all they came across in order to taste success.\n",
      "Review 4667: Just saw the first episode only... and a big thank you coming from bottom of my heart for creating this wonderful series. Thank you for make us experienced the large legendary history of India.\n",
      "Review 4668: Jim Sarbh as Homi Bhabha was the only thing worth watching in this, he was fantastic.The rest of it is cheeseball garbage. There is never any science or details mentioned or any scientific problems for them to solve.Every problem is a person to person one and solved with a string of flowing words, rather than actual action and solutions. It really gets ridiculous and happens time and time again, someone will be dead-set against something for a long time and then one of the main characters comes along and says the equivalent of \"come on\" and then they say \"ok fine\"For a show about scientists that I was interested in, I was extremely disappointed by the lack of science with manufactured drama interjected in place instead.\n",
      "Review 4669: Really inspiring. A must watch for all generations to know what hardships our founding fathers faced to create modern india. Epic story telling with great screenplay and brilliant acting from all acting.\n",
      "Review 4670: The series is about the history of great indian scientists. How the Indian scientists managed to build the first nuclear power station against all odds.It tells you how big countries like the US, never wanted India to rise and did all they could to stop the country from rising.Well narrated and well directed, with some brilliant performances.Jim Sarab was brilliant, nobody could have done it better then him.\n",
      "Review 4671: Progresses beautifully, love the screenplay and setting. The vibes hit so well! Keeps you engaged. Definitely gives you goosebumps! The actors are brilliant! Jim Sarbh is so underrated smh!!\n",
      "Review 4672: Storyline is too slow to tolerate. They totally distracted from the main focus of the movie which should be related to rocket. I started to watch keeping in mind that it is science fiction movie with Hollywood level. The entire series could be completed in a movie but makers have tried to extend this series. If you are getting bore then it's better getting bore than watching this series.\n",
      "Review 4673: Sony LIV has come with a brilliant series again. ROCKET BOYS- this is such a good dedication to our scientists Bhabha, Sarabhai and Kalam who put india in line of nuclear energy and space research.Acting is brilliant from the reel characters as well as the supporting cast. Look and feel wise the series looks brilliant. The first nuclear reactor and first rocket launch which many of us we indian wouldn't have witnessed will get goosebumps for sure. A real sense of pride of what these people did in their lives. This should be watched guys. Indians go for it cos this matters to us :-)\n",
      "Review 4674: #RocketBoys is such an amazing watch. A perfect blend of everything that anyone would crave for! Brilliant effort to showcase some scientific geniuses of India. Long live Indian scientists.@jimSarbh was such a treat to watch and so are @IshwakSingh and others! Thank u @SonyLIV.\n",
      "Review 4675: Shameful movie to show negative side of great Scientists for young generations..Vikram have extra marital affairs, and homi was too busy in sex, alchohol and cigarettes!!Seems like this movie was funded by CIA.. lol..Movie should to be inspirational but mostly shame..!!\n",
      "Review 4676: #Proud #Legendary #EpicThat's how you can describe the webseries 'Rocket Boys'A perfect representation of the lives of 2 legendary minds of India. Dr. Homi Bhabha & Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. Jim Sarbh & Ishwak Singh lives their respective characters and shine in the roles. The emergence of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is brilliantly shown in the series. The BGM by Achint who gave us SCAM delivers yet again. The best part is the screenplay, the detailing of the events & the dialogues. Everything is just perfect about this series. SonyLiv delivers a masterpiece yet again.Waiting for Season 2 already..!!\n",
      "Review 4677: Guys I'm not a person who write comments on social media. But I had to . Because this is a worthy webseries to see legends like CV Raman the Nobel laureate, Dr. Sarabhai , Homi Jahangir Bhabha, Mr JRD Tata, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam sir in one frame. Please do watch it.\n",
      "Review 4678: Only demerit is Its slow paced and unnecessary irrelevant events included which drags it longer . If it was finished in 5 or 6 episodes , it would have been the Best! Butt the way things corelate and exact interpretation of the timeline of history and the happening of events simply make it awesome ! I have become a devotee of Dr HOMI Bhabha after watching the series. Got to know a lot about him . INDIA NEEDS MORE SUCH SERIES !! THANKS TO THE DIRECTOR !!\n",
      "Review 4679: Everything is good about it..But Woke director Pannu creates a fictional Muslim scientist that is Good..And a fictional Hindu Scientist Mathur that is bad...He did this to show Islamophobia in society...Failing to acknowledge that APJ Abdul Kalam was also the part of the mission.Nehru is shown in good light... Which is contradictory to his image.\n",
      "Review 4680: I'm proud of Sony liv to let us know about the greatest scientists. This series is a periodic table to me. Study of 108 metals and nonmetals at a single glance. Brilliant work. Kudos to the creators and actors. Please produce more series which inspires us and more inclined towards Indian history and scientists.\n",
      "Review 4681: A good content based series which is also well researched after a long while. Jim Sarbh is fantastic. Though the personality, genius and contribution of Dr. Homi Bhabha is such that it warrants a movie or series of its own. This is a rare content which is inspirational. Must watch!\n",
      "Review 4682: Fresh casting. Amazing acting. Good storyline. Good direction. In short don't miss.Finally a good period drama on Indian history and not the independence movement or sports or monarchies. A barely explored subject of Indian scientific achievements is the key plot here along with a brief glimpse of the post independence political situation of India. Indian Scientists were always neglected in indian cinema. So we knew about them and their achievements, only from the history books which is quite cut and dry. So learning about the great scientific minds of India Dr. Homi J Bhaba and Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and their life , their struggle, their pain , their success is an absolute delight to watch. Some flaws are there while creating the period and that can be ignored.\n",
      "Review 4683: Feeling so so proud.....Homi Bhabha, Sarabhai and Kalam.....great to know so much about them.....11/10.....Unbelievable......Jim Sarbh (Malik Kafoor) acted so well and Iswak Singh and also Kalam was acted very well......Nehru and his idealism failing....... Absolutely wonderful......\n",

      "Review 4685: Phenomenal.Just phenomenal. Just FYI before anyone comments that Parsis are not Gujjus, pls don't get confused between ethnicity (region) and religion.\n",
      "Review 4686: it simply series where you feel good............it gives you goosebumps that certainly what i expect from this type of seriesin this busy life where everything we watch in 2x, it grasp you attention make you feel stay relax you do not have to do anything that is the main thing of this seriesand that what i look for in the series .............whether they belong to any genre...............i just simply suggest you open the series and rest work is done by the series.\n",
      "Review 4687: Very well done and outstanding acting!We need more series like this which portray moments when India made history and the people who were behind the revolutionary changes. It not only educates people, but also inspires those who want to make a difference.\n",

      "Review 4690: Must watch, great work by everyone who is part of the series. Proud and patriotic. One of the best series of its kind. Every one should watch it atleast once.\n",
      "Review 4691: Amazing direction screenplay and what a justice by lead actor .This is certainly a new era of Indian ott platform where we see lot of nudity violence and foul language... but RB is worth watching a single scene with family ... dialogue acting humour are at best .Jim Sarbh : hidden Gem of film industry... he seriously nailed it ... loved to watch his acting ( for the first time as he did not get any good chance apart from Taish )Overall 20 out of 10 to RB.\n",
      "Review 4692: It's one of the best series on our scientific Heroes and a great story of extraordinary men. I would recommend this series to all youth so that they can understand the sacrifices and good deeds of our old generation scientist to get us here.\n",
      "Review 4693: The show could have been better if they removed the fictional character Raza totally not required why are you showing a Muslim as a villain that too fictional second biggest mistake as any other Sony TV problem is over dramatization . I encouraged many people to watch this show and only got disappointed when the show became soap opera with unwanted side stories his family and romance totally not needed here.\n",
      "Review 4694: The series is great from start to finish ! Jim is classy as Homi, Ishwak as Dr Vikram is a revelation and the rest of the cast deserve an applause. Credit where its due to the heroes of our nation who equally contributed and fought for our freedom ! Special mention to the background music. It sure gives goosebumps at several intervals. Do not miss !\n",
      "Review 4695: I must say Indian web series level is going up day by day.Outstanding actors and fantastic acting. Specially Vikram and Bhomi.You well get to know the struggle they have faced but they didn't quit.Also some glimpse of Dr A PJ Abdul Kalam.Feel proud.\n",
      "Review 4696: A complete package of humour, wit, sarcasm, brilliance, emotions, tragedy, courage and history.This series is a masterpiece in its own. The vibe of the indian freedom struggle, the scene of the eve of indian independence are ensured to give you goosebumps. A sneak peak into the class and minds of the nation's best brains is something you won't want to miss.After watching this series, trust me you'll start valuing your independence more than ever and realise that your struggles are far more easily dealable.\n",
      "Review 4697: An excellent depiction of what probably happened in Indian history. To watch a serial that has APJ Abdul Kalam, Pandit Nehru, Homi Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai, among other historic figures, is really interesting. I forgot that It was Jim Sarah and started believing that I was actually watching Homi Bhabha on screen.Please hurry and bring Season 2.\n",
      "Review 4698: This show takes you back to the pre-independence era, independence times and post-independence times. There is journey of India with journey of these Rocket Boys. The characters are powerful and narration of story is engaging at all times. The powerful characters like ABJ Abdul Kalam sir, our 1st Prime Minister are also good to watch to know them as a person.This show should be watched by all Indians.Cheers to the makers, team and actors for this Masterpiece.\n",
      "Review 4699: I haven't bored for a second while watching this series. What an engaging TV show or called web series nowadays. It's worth watch shows. I would recommend you watch with family, especially with kids.This show shows us what happened after independent in science and technologies. And what an acting by each actor. It's simply awesome show.\n",
      "Review 4700: The series failed to quench my thirst for the scientific achievements and work done by Dr Homi Bhaba and Dr Vikram Sarabhai.It was more of digging into the personal lives, love triangles, failed marriage of these legends. These personal failures are insignificant in front of their accomplishments. The movie seemed to belittle their character.It's good to have a holistic view, but the personal life could have taken the back seat. The story writer and director seemed to be more interested in catering to the typical masala movie audience.Some good quality biopics for your reference are \"The Beautiful Mind\" on Dr John Nash, \"The man who knew infinity\" on Ramanujan, \"The Imitation Game\" on Alan Turing.\n",
      "Review 4701: When I watched the trailer could not stop me to watch the show on tata play Binge.This show will take back you 40's and 50', with neat dramatic narration without much heroism.I am waiting for season 2 to watch APJ story.\n",
      "Review 4702: It is beyond imagination how a biography can have facts which are far from reality. Infact, it's a pure Bollywood masala story with hardly any fact that is correct. Meghnad Saha has been replaced by a fictional character (yes fictional character in biography). The reason being that this fictional character is shown as a muslim and the main villain. The entire story of Kalam is poorly shown. CV Raman is shown as a spineless individual. It's really time that censorship should step in and should moderate the creative liberties that can be taken if it's portrayed as a biography. Otherwise the new-generation will learn an entirely false history about these scientific geniuses.\n",

      "Review 4704: Acting, story, cinematography. Just simply a outstanding. People from all around the world must watch how two scientist lived their life in ups and down and pulled things. People don't know much about them outside academic scholars and the way this story being told here is just charisma. The patriotism showing in very subtle organic way. The anger, the zeal for science and nature. Just go utilise your time in the best possible way and learn something beautiful about journey of two excellent scientist.\n",
      "Review 4705: From the very first teaser of this show I was overly excited for this. And I'd say this show didn't disappoint me. I was hoping something good and with crossed fingers I was waiting to watch it, and every episode lived far better than my expectations. I already knew the story because I love this part of our history, but the execution was so beautifully done it was clear treat to my eyes. Every character was perfectly crafted and brilliantly played by each and every actor. Apart from story music was so beautiful and grounded. There are very few series or shows where I don't skip the intro of the show, trust me I have skipped every intro song of \"Friends\" but it's different with Rocket Boys.Direction was amazing, dialogues were impactful, screenplay was super. But it's not a perfect show it has it's own flaws and limitations. Overall highly highly recommended for all and don't just watch it try to live it.\n",
      "Review 4706: This series is one of kind web series for Indian viewer must watch because of India's struggle after and before freedom in1947 for development. Most of Indian know and talking about politics but they very little know about how India Stand up on their own best minds of India. Every young people must watch this series and suggest their if they interested in watching web series. Also acting and direction is too beautiful and Fantastic. Well done and ThanQ Sony India for bringing series to us.\n",
      "Review 4707: We have all heard and read about the Dr. Bhabha and Dr. Sarabhai, but little did we know about their trailblazing genius.This series is an magnificent tribute to Indian scientific luminaries, their trials and tribulations and a sneak peak in to lives of greatest Indians like Dr. Kalam. From the cinematography to the background score, this is truly Indian television's OTT's off age.Absolute top shelf stuff, pips Family man and Patalok, if only by just.\n",
      "Review 4708: Lovely to see the india's best scientists story with great screenplay, casting and bgm is too good...even you can't skip intro due to music....frictional part also look perfect in the series...it just not grab you but make you proid indian...awsome series.....must watch...don't miss chance to live life of Dr. Homi bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai's story.\n",
      "Review 4709: Jim is exceptional and all the cast did good work .. a must watch for all. They tried to show the history with a true spirit and became successful also.\n",
      "Review 4710: Rocket boys revolve around the story of India's first space program and nuclear energy. The series is must watch for today's generation its inspirational, knowledgable and it teaches how to be consistent towards your dream and achieve it no matter how odd the situations are. This web series is dedicated to three legends who are the big guns in their industry Dr Vikram Sarabhai (Father of the Indian Space program), Dr Homi Jahangir Babha (Father of Nuclear Program) and Dr APJ Abdul Kalam (The Missile Man of India). Jim Sarabh, Ishwak Singh, Regina Cassandra, Rajat Kapur and Arjun Radhakrishnan the cast were perfect and did justice to their characters. I would highly recommend this movie to today's young generation it is one of the best series in Indian ott history. Thanks, sony liv for bringing this series to the audience.\n",
      "Review 4711: This is one of the great web series with great acting and storyline.BUT when all main characters were given real names, why was Raza as a character given a Muslim name and this seems something fishy. The 1st Cyclotron in India was made by a Hindu, so why was a different religion name chosen to showcase the negative character in him throughout the show?It deserves 9 star rating, but with the fishy stuff I am limiting it to 5 stars.\n",
      "Review 4712: After a great success of Part-1 had high hopes on Part-2 but turned out to be more of a Political drama than Scientific program.Most of the story had fictional theories like death of LBS, after the death of Homi differences between Ramanna and Sethna lead to disastrous halt bcoz of which the nuclear program had completely derailed and kept in back without much of a support from the govt. Otherwise after a successful Nuclear launch why would a PM opt for Emergency. Why was she under pressure. Anyhow the producer RaGa(in the opening credits of Ep1) got what he wanted to be shown. Overall an average show.\n",
      "Review 4713: A beautiful way to show the brilliant minds of our country and the effort they put to build the nation.Not a single second goes by for u to think this wasn't required. Every detail led out and captivates you to watch it. In recent times the only series i couldnt control to watch next day and took the night off for this one.\n",
      "Review 4714: This series provides the audience details of the country's progress in space and atomic research which has the Rocket boys - Dr Homi Bhabha and Dr Vikram Sarabai in the forefront.The story telling, acting and direction is all world class. Overall a great series.\n",
      "Review 4715: I loved the theme, concept ,detailing,cast , dialogues the way makers presented an era so convincingly, we are sure there is a big intelligent team behind the camera for deep research.... congratulations Roy Kapoor and thanks to bring that time so beautifully ........ Jim is amazingly and fantastically played the character like he is born to play the role of great Dr. Babha......we apriciate the whole team and Waiting for more projects like that because we need to now all the effort made by the great heroes of that timw to make our lives easy and comfortable, today we are happily using many thing without knowing the pain,sacrifices and efforts made behind tham.\n",
      "Review 4716: Plot is good but unnecessary side stories and content irrelevant to name they choosed.It's like autobiography of Vikram and bhabha. Kalam portrayed with false story. Just a hype created by sony liv to get subscribers.\n",
      "Review 4717: We have witnessed best web series in India from last few years but rocket boys comes above every other and the reasons are stated below:1. From story, screenplay, direction and acting it stands in every human department. It have touched the scientist personal life to professional life along with their own form of nationalism. So overall it is balanced in all the aspect2. How the timeframe is shown is the best for a period drama like this which is most important3. Last but not the least the story is more about a country is becoming more stronger among all the odds and two brave scientists plays a major role in it so pure nationalism.\n",
      "Review 4718: Superb cinematography, awesome story telling, great visuals and colour tone, great acting and Bhabaüî•. Everyone needs to see this series for inspiring makers to make such interesting web series. I have seen so many indian web series in past. But the cinematography of these series specially in season 2 is outstanding. Hollywood level series it is. We came to know so much interesting facts about bhaba, Sarabhai and kalam's chemistry in this series. I'm telling again this type of series should get nominated for international awards also. The direction and storytelling part is also one of the best I have seen in such a long years.\n",
      "Review 4719: Really proud of the way this series makes you feel about our brave scientists. Very less shows / movies today are able to elicit the nationalist feeling that this series has. Kudos to the story writer for that.With the flawless direction it feels like the cast was made for this series. Just perfect! Not a single episode feels out of place especially in the 2nd series till now (I am done with half of the series till now).Jim Sarbh seems like a second incarnation of Homi Bhaba. The complex storyline with him and Raza is top class. The inherent struggle to accept the truth behind Raza's plea of innocence is worth watching.Go watch this series if you haven't already!\n",
      "Review 4720: The subject of the series excited me to know lifetimes of the two greatest scientists during independence era Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai. Great storyline screenplay cinematography, powerful dialogue and power pact performance especially by Jim Sarbh as Homi Bhabha. However background music was very weak, there was no scientist name mehdi raza but a calculator based scientist name Meghnad Saha. No need to always bring things for the heck of it. I shaak though promising but in later half of series couldn't create much impact.\n",
      "Review 4721: Rocket Boys is one of the best inspirational series i have come across in the recent time.We are so proud of our country for what it is today, but we know so less about the people who were responsible to make the country proud in this case - scientists.During schooling we have learnt so much about the kings and rulers but very less about the struggles and achievements of these revolutionaries. Kudos to the whole Rocket Boys team to bring their stories to Limelight.After seeing the series, there is some kind of proudness, excitement and hunger to do something for the country. It is a great feeling to carry, thank you :)\n",
      "Review 4722: I have self motivated myself to do things in life. But had I got chance to see this series earlier in life, it would have transformed my future course of action. All the actors are too notch. Every actor in this series has given best performance of their acting life till now. This series has only strengthened my belief that with a truly high ambition and never say no attitude to working hard towards your set goals, you can create an entity which will help future leaders come out of it. Way to go Team #Rockeyboys. You really rocked. From me it's 10 out of 10 score. Create some more webseries on real life Indian Heroes to inspire our present and future generations to do wonder.\n",
      "Review 4723: Get an up-close and personal insight of India's icons but through intriguing story line and awesome performances.It was indeed a very entertaining general knowledge class for me.A must watch ...if possible ignore 1-2 episode that unnecessarily surrounds the family drama.\n",
      "Review 4724: A must watch series for all the INDIANS.Can't believe finally Indian cinema has created which should have created long back. And most importantly they have got the platforms. Salute to HJ Bhabha, V sarabhai, Ramanna ji, Kalam sir and all the scientists who played their role in making modern India. Also, thanks to politicians who supported them. Nehru, shastri, Indira. Definately, this series will make you think why this country is made great by the efforts of millions who have their everything. Not to forget the ones like Raja mehndi who won't get recognised.Along with the story, the cinematography and the technical details provided is also impressive.\n",
      "Review 4725: Every science guy who loves science if any field should watch this. Also those who want to know who helped contributed creste base for india's space,atomic success....\n",
      "Review 4726: When you want to know about such legends you would first like to know their contribution and how they achieved it. Season 1 was pretty much like a typical Indian soap where the focus on personal life and love affairs. Season 1 seemed more like a view point through the lens of Mallika Sarabhai, who never fathomed the magnanimity of her father. So in my opinion Season 1 didn't meet my expectations.However I am very impressed with Season 2 which focuses on their struggles, vision and their contribution with very little emphasis on their personal life. It helped understand the power struggle at that point of time when India was fighting the likes of CIA. Today we stand as a powerful nation only because of the likes of such scientists who had the courage to take the bold steps.\n",
      "Review 4727: I watched season 1 and Season 2. Extremely inspiring and provides the struggle Indian scientists had to face during those eventful times.Highly top class performances by the protagonists. Teaches you to some extent the chronological history of India from pre independence till 1974. Shows the trials and tribulations of the scientists who had to struggle with what ever was available to achieve the breakthrough in rocket science and atomic energy. Personification of excellence by team of rocket boys. Recreation of the iconic institutions in the 1950s is really appreciable. Kept me addicted until I completed both Season 1 and Season 2.I really thank the producer of this series for sponsoring the Rocket Boys web series as it shows India's struggle in the initial days. It will appeal to all Indians.\n",
      "Review 4728: I watched first season and was mesmerized and eagerly waiting for second season but as expected they introduced fictional character Dr. Raza ( it was in first season also) which is of no need and shown victimized ( no wonder why). And off course villians name is Mathur. To much emphasis is given on personal life of both great characters whereas I was expecting or interested in science part. Anyway its my personal opinion. Remarkable performance by all actor specially Jim he had nailed it. Some contents of episodes seemed half cooked specially related to political situation of that time. Editing could have been better.\n",
      "Review 4729: Quite a detailed series of Indian space as well as nuclear program and how heroes of our country like Dr. Homi Bhabha, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam did their best for India !! Background music is on point in line with events happening on screen. Creative liberty does justice to the hard work of people who contributed their life to this country since pre independence. Their ambitions and achievements are well portrayed on screen with excellent direction. Lastly kudos to acting skills of Jim Sarbh!!Season 1 starts with pre independence era and world war 2 event which slowly progresses towards post independence era where India proves it's ability to the world that India could be a nuclear nation and can make its own space program along with other nations!!A must watch if u have interest in history..\n",
      "Review 4730: Sony LIV Rocket boys make Indians proud, how Indian scientist make india space program from bottom to world great institutions and inspirations to billion people of India forward step at any condition.\n",
      "Review 4731: It is just the kind of stuff that pulls me towards it to binge watch.Brilliant acting, detailing, cinematography, characters,Storyline is as par with the top notch stuff.Must watch.I feel proud and happy after watching this one.JIM SARBH just nailed it.Soo underrated actor.\n",
      "Review 4732: We should be very thankful to the producer, doctor aud authors to come with this master piece.What a great work presenting the story of Indian Scientists as well as Science in a decent way.\n",
      "Review 4733: How can I watch this family type series with illiterate but history love grandparents?Almost Every dialogue is in english like your hindi dialogues are fillers in this series!!+ The relationship type things were not expected by me because of its sick intro!!!\n",
      "Review 4734: Such a fabulous series,Just couldn't feel how a 45 min long episode endsScreenplay, direction, editing is all so good.The intro music is justüî•üî•üî•üî•Apart from that, the series appropriately portrays the situation faced by the scientists during those times, the starting of a new nuclear reactor, the war with chinaEvery thing felt so alive.\n",
      "Review 4735: Acting... screenplay...story all top notch ... actors are amazing ... though bhabha's character looks best among the rest... Well done Sony liv...Best part is reality about legends without sugar coating ...brave attempt ...one of the best web series...best after Chernobyl.\n",
      "Review 4736: Yes you hear right it is the biopic of two great mind of India. Not like a fency bollywood tadka movie. You fill like you are there in there era. Great direction but too much English in every scenes. Overall a great experience in watching this realistic biopic without any misleading in the story.\n",
      "Review 4737: Simply the most inspiring web series till dateEnjoyed it throughoutGreat Execution,good scripting and great acting by Jim and Ishwak .Good comic timing in between scenes and very well directed by Abhay PannuIt tells story of struggles and conspiracies Indian scientists went through to make India a strong and magnificent country she is today .\n",
      "Review 4738: Very good series that throws light on the vital contributions of two premier scientists in modern India - Dr. Homi Bhabha and Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.The success of the series lies in the very fact that it makes you want to go and read to know more about these unsung heroes.\n",
      "Review 4739: This series is for those who loves good intellectual content over casual watch. Based on true story about India's 2 greatest minds, in 2nd season the level of the storytelling becomes more prominent with political drama after death of PM Nehru and malicious attempt of CIA to derail India's nuclear project. This series is a treat for those Indian series lover who love to watch sci fi and slow burn espionage thriller because I am sure there is not any single Indian series which has this level ofscience fiction, espionage, slow burn political dramma packed. Great respect to the director, actors who put up a magnificent job.\n",
      "Review 4740: An absolute honour to watch rocket boys 2 . One of the best Indian web series ever. Brilliance of narration, scripting well researched corroborative content also so matur , no abuse , no sex, no violence yet so crisp. No fiction just added the needed emotions. Hats off to actors and the crew for such brilliant execution. You have paved a way for matured content in the skies of indian web series... i think u have paved way for season 3 i can smell the plot... 2 of my high points characterisation so realistic to original and the way relationships in that era is been handled with a matured approach... and to the amount of research gone to keep it away from fiction...\n",
      "Review 4741: I expected that this series will focus more on Science and innovations of our great scientist. But the series focus more on showing personal life of Sarabhai and political challenges faced. Still a decent one time watch. Great acting by all the actors.\n",
      "Review 4742: There are many review from different perspective,I am writing on the basis of changes I felt in this show and other shows based upon those times1. First time I can see that someone thought to put glory of recent India, people behind it and different flavours of their struggle2. It shows dark side too which is mostly focus in other stories/show viz. Poverty and traitors, but show put the main focus on how courageous they were, how mad they were for their country and inspire how we supposed to be.3. It is not a master piece in all sections, but story covers all of the sections and if you're in immense love with your country it is a 10 on 10.\n",
      "Review 4743: For sure it is one of the most brilliantly making series in Indian history . Story, direction, cine-photography,Editing, Acting all are top notch . And in my opinion the best decision was to consider Jim as a Homi character . He really took it to a different dimension by his acting skill. Hats off the whole team .\n",
      "Review 4744: Plain vanilla setup, not worth the time.Even the simple straight forward dialogues are just twisted too much, almost like trying too hard. And, the most obvious things are discussed in such depth that you feel stupid at the end of it.\n",
      "Review 4745: Such a great story to tell<33 ! I really appreciate about the biography nd etc! Waiting for season 2. Homi nd Vikram did great specially Homi .. I just like his character nd for sure acting! Exciting for new season!\n",

He stood extremely brilliant and spectacular in this series that makes me watch till the end and end me up with tears. Hats off to him. He is undoubtedly the Gem of the industry. I watch his all movies and series and he always show his brilliance by putting his whole heart and efforts in Every character. He should be recognise for his brilliance. 100 stars to him.

      "Review 4765: Nice story writing. This series covers everything behind India's nuclear reactor and 1st rocket except for the science and technology used to make it. It is necessary to show the politics involved but there is no need to show the events of personal life of the scientists'. A whole episode have been devoted to the courtship of Vikaram Sarabhai and Mrinalini.In my opinion this is not a scientific series. It is a political drama.\n",

      "Review 4768: Never thought that a mere documentry could be such engaging to watch, the way the story has been displayed is simply fantastic. Talking about the acting the one played Homi Bhabha did a fantastic job. Removing one star because the series could have been more long.\n",
      "Review 4769: Acting 10/10Direction 10/10Music 10/10Characterization: 10/10Story (Drama) 9/10Story (Fact) 7/10They do take a lot of creative liberties, but I guess the general audience won't have liked it if it was all about their struggles and science. It connects with science haters like me because they haven't info dumped or used a lot of jargon. I still think they could have reduced Mrinalini's screen space and focused more on Sarabhai's professional endeavors.\n",

      "Review 4791: Why you always need a negative muslim character to spide up the story..there was never such person Raza Mehdi the actual name of the person his character based upon was Meghnad but the makers decided to change his name to show a communal angle in the web series. That is manipulation and should be called out.\n",
      "Review 4792: The video is mix up of feelings and ambitions of 2 different identities Mr. Homi and Mr. Sarabhai. The series sums up everything in these 8 episodes from showing how it started, problems & achievements and the conspiracies associated.

It was such an incredible feeling to see how the series of events played in the lifes of Dr Homi bhabha and Dr Vikram Srabhai, The super stars of Indian Physics and Space research programs. The relationship between the two, the conversations, the developments started from the company of Dr C. V. Raman. What an soul filling experience to watch the Greatest scientists of Indian. Dr Vikaram Sarabhai, the father of Modern education in India. He is founder of IIMA and INCOSPAR and many such institutions. Its cherry on top to sir our favourate Dr. A. P. J.

The main part of the series is that the audience will have the interest from the first glance of the first episode. Indeed a piece of Art. Paisa Vasool üòÄ.\n",
      "Review 4800: Today on 27-02-2022, I finished the last episode of the series. Today is also 3rd day of the Russia-Ukraine War, Russia invaded Ukraine & the major reason is the NATO expansion and Ukraine's disloyalty to Moscow. But one thing became very clear that Ukraine has either become too much dependent on the west or assuming that the West will do everything to save them.This series taught me that we must NOT depend on others at least not too much. Be ATMANIRBHAR. Big boys have realized very early & proved that India's needs can be atmanirbhar. Vikram, Bhabha, Kalam, and others have made immense contributions to our nation.\n",
      "Review 4801: Just Start it, And You won't stop watching it till it's end, The cast, the acting, the screen play the BGM, Wow, Watching Homie Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai and APJ Abdul Kalam in one frame, What a moment it would have been for those who must have witness the same in reality for those who still live today to witness from where we started and where we have reached today.Spoiler Alert :: The series will give you several goosebumps.\n",

      "Review 4805: Great Detailing, Research, Costume, Cinematography to put this into a show!The journey of all the Fellow Legends in the fields is correctly depicted & given Justice to.\n",
      "Review 4806: The story and screenplay is crisp and to the point. The characters are written and played beautifully . The actors have done a brilliant job.
